# Front-end Developer Exercise  - Submission

**Completed by Robert Tate on 6/21/2018** 

## Overview:

In this exercise, my task was to complete a working site based on the provided mockup. In order to make this site still functional without any JavaScript, I structured it by using multiple .html pages. CSS animations are employed so that transitions still exist without any additional help.

Each .html page refers to its own JavaScript file, where AJAX requests are used to dynamically render content for each section.

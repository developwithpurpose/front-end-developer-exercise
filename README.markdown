Updated Overview
--------
This is a reworked demo developed by Cortney Robinson. I have added several assets and changed the task manager from grunt to gulp. Directions for running the server are listed below. 

Assets
---------
I have include several additional assets to complete this demo while attempting to maintain a minimal approach as suggested. The additional assets are listed below.

CSS/SASS:
bootstrap grid framework

JS:
gulp.js
Handlebar.js
respond.js
jQuery
html5shiv


Resources
------
Rather than using image files to represent icons on the page. I converted svg assets into a font icon using icomoon. These assets can be found in resources/iconfonts/



Server
------

I've switched the project over from grunt to gulp. This package has a `gulpfile.js` that you can use to serve up your application. First make sure that node.js is installed [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Once Node.js is installed and the repo is cloned , run the following commands to get the server up and open the landing webpage.

```
npm install
gulp 
open http://localhost:9001/app/index.html in the browser
```

Front-End Developer Exercise
============================

The submission for the Front-End Developer Exercise fully implements the provided mock-up and requirements document
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Where appropriate, it leverages existing code libraries to facilitate the design.

1. Bootstrap
While used very lightly, I like to include Bootstrap as a first step to any new project. It provides convenient and reusable CSS
constructs without needing to recreate the wheel on each project.

2. jQuery
Like Booststrap, jQuery provides a cross-browser-compatible set of constructs which enhance the use of the underlying technology. In this exercide,
jQuery was used exclusively in the Dynamic Content section per the requirements.

3. CSS-Based Tabbed Content
While I would normally implement this in Javascript, a solution was developed which does not rely on Javascript and fully uses CSS. It was based 
on the Pure CSS3 Tab Effects at [http://www.cssscript.com/demo/pure-css3-tab-effects/].

4. Google Fonts
Google Fonts was used to load the required Source Sans Pro font. [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro]

5. Content Distribution Networks (CDNs)
CDNs were leveraged for Bootstrap, jQuery, and Google Fonts. This reduces local resource management and can improve performance and load time as well.

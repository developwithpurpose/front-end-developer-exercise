## Front-end-developer-exercise-master 

this is my submission for the front-end developer exercise for the role of junior front-web developer.

NPM 

first, I made sure Node was installed and I directed into my project folder through Hyper terminal. I then installed and started NPM, testing that the server was successfully running. I also installed nodemon to make sure any changes were saved and updated on the server. I also included a git repository to make sure I didn't mess up and have to redo successful code. 

INDEX.HTML

I started laying out the page by looking at the mockup and identifying what tags and classes to use.

STYLE.CSS

I referred to the annotated mockup to make sure it was matching. 

MAIN.JS

I wanted to make sure the vertical tabs had a seamless transition, providing the correct information with each step. I also tried to make the transition smoother but was unable to due to the alloted time. 

I also started to start my Dynamic content with a ajax request using the JSON file. Unfortunately, I did not have time to finish but will keep working on this in my own personal time. 

Overall, the 4 hours went by fast and looking at the final project, I would change some things. (Using the header picture and displaying text seperately instead of the graphic with text on the index.html page, AJAX request finished, some styling edits, etc.) My goal, however, was to have a page that looked similar to the mockup in 4 hours. I was very nervous as this was my first coding challenge and definitely had to promblem solve but I felt confident in finding a solution the problems I encountered.

I hope this successfully shows my skills and my willingness to learn while growing into a developer. I know it is not my best work but I will only grow from here. 


Thank you for the opportunity and challenge!

###Submission by Ivan Hale

- This application was developed while using a 1280x800 screen. This must be taken into consideration during evaluation, since no viewport dimension was specified, and responsiveness is not being evaluated.

- I wrote as much "vanilla" JavaScript as possible to build the application within a reasonable timeframe, but I eventually had to mix in some jQuery for the "Dynamic Content" section.

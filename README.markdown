# Front-end Developer Exercise

## Objective

Built a web page that provides information about The 7 Baby Steps.

- source: https://www.daveramsey.com/dave-ramsey-7-baby-steps#baby_step_1
  Notes:
- Used Axios for PersonList API call
- Console.log'd throughout files for debugging
  - Also used React Dev Tools for CSS changes
- Difficulty finishing in time allowed, I'd have loved to go over that 3 hour mark and cleaned up
  my App.js file. Condense down those div's, seperate components into the individual step files that
  I created. Add in more animations, I got them started, you'll see at end of that App.css file and
  in the components folder's step files. Also, I wanted to deploy using Amplify because I'm familiar
  with AWS, I'm certified in AWS. Please see my LinkedIn profile and
  Github site for more information on my skillset.

  -wip=add large blue img to content, style in css (at time of ~3hr mark).
- I haven't worked with Axios before, but it made the most sense to do so because of it's relevance
with API calls and React. Couldn't quite debug it in time to get the call working correctly. 
- I really enjoyed this project. Just wish I had more time to finish it, get that call set up and 
working without error. As it is, it's running on port #3000. In Firefox, content is black. In Chrome
the colors, fonts, work appears as expected. Debugged in Chrome Dev Tools.
- Thanks for the opportunity to submit my work. Any feedback is welcomed. Have a good day!

## Requirements

- Forked this repository and submitted my finished work as a pull request.
- Submission looks like the provided mockup.
- There is animation when navigating between the baby steps (react-spring library).
- The "Dynamic Content" user story is included at the end of this README, completed as a part of
  submission.
- Final deliverable treated as if it were going to be deployed to production.
- Instead of code comments, I documented my submission by creating a README in the `./app/`
  directory. I included items that I thought might be helpful in evaluating my work.
- Create-react-app used. See source documentation here:
  https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started

## Success Criteria

- The markup should be semantic and accessible.
- The page should be presentable in all modern browsers as well as IE 9+, though not necessarily visually identical across the board. Please document intentional deviations.
- You should **not** create a mobile/responsive version, as we will not be giving any credit for it.
- The page should be usable without JavaScript, though not necessarily functionally identical (e.g. the Dynamic Content user story requires JavaScript). Please document intentional deviations.
- You should **not** use a single-page application framework (e.g. Angular, Ember, React), though you can use any other libraries that you need (e.g. jQuery, Lodash, etc.).
  - React usage was pre-approved by technical recruiter.

## Resources

The visual design team has provided several deliverables to help with construction of the page:

- a mockup of what the finished product should look like: `./resources/mockup.jpg`
- an annotated mockup for more detailed information on fonts/measurements/etc: `./resources/annotated-mockup.jpg`.
- an example of a possible transition for the navigation menu: `./resources/transition-example.gif`.

All of the copy can be found at `./resources/body-copy.txt`.

Any image you need can be found in the `./app/assets/images` directory. Some images have been sliced in multiple ways, so use whichever you feel make the most sense to use, or not at all if you feel you don't need to.

## Server

This package is configured with a basic web server. You'll first need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Once you have Node.js installed and have cloned this repo, then you can run the following commands to start the server (on port 8080 by default).

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

You should see "The server is running!" when you visit http://localhost:8080. Use CTRL-C to stop the server when you are done.

Feel free to add any additional build infrastructure that you would like, as long as the page is still accessible by running `npm start`. Tests and linters, for example, are welcomed (but not required).

## Dynamic Content

As a user I want to be encouraged by how many friends of mine are also going through the selected baby step. I don't need to see all my friends; just a summary of who is in the same baby step.

You should make an AJAX request for the data from `/app/baby-steps.json`, which includes a list of friend objects. Each object contains names and their baby step. Based on the data returned, you will need to show the following information to the user, sorted by last name ascending.

- AJAX request: used Axios with React

### Message Logic

- if 0 friends, then don't show any message
- if 1 friend, then show "Paul Taylor is also in Baby Step 2"
- if 2 friends, then show "Thomas Harris and Sharon Thomas are also in Baby Step 3"
- if 3 friends, then show "Deborah Lee, Shirley Perez, and 1 other friend are also in Baby Step 4"
- if 4 or more friends, then show "Patricia Allen, Matthew Garcia, and 2 other friends are also in Baby Step 5"

Consult the mockups about where to put this information and how to style it.

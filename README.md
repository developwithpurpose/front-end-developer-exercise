Drop the entire /app directory into htdocs 

### Prerequisites

Web Server. No database needed.
Note you have to have a connection to the outside internet to retrieve the google fonts and min.js otherwise it will not work. Normally, it is a good idea to store them locally but in this case I have choosen to link them.
If this were https the link would break.

Summary
--------------

* I know we were not suppose to spend more than 4 hours on this
    code challenge, but I wanted to do my best.
* I used a little bit of pure JavaScript and jQuery.

Areas of Opportunity
------------------------------

* Better use of CSS to manipulate the baby step container without using
    JavaScript to do all the work.
* Use of better functions to display friends on each baby step
* Clean up code for easier reading.

Document your submission here (optional, but recommended)
I am going to be honest here.

I had this near completion when I went back and saw the functional without js requirement. So that incited a bit of a scramble on my part.
Oh well, that is what I get for not reading carefully.

I intentionally left off the loading navigation. There is not a need for it, as this loads quickly.
If you need to see if I can do some css animation stuff you can find that here: https://experienceoysterpark.com/ - lower left of the page(s)

The basics here have been completed quite successfully given the time frame (from not reading - totally on me!).

I was unsure if you wanted the header images on each step as images, or as backgrounds.
I went with backgrounds so I could keep everything in the css and loading faster.

Lastly, whoever is viewing this, thank you for your time it is much appreciated. As a busy developer myself I am grateful you took the time for my submission review.
God Bless.

Within the time allowed, I was not able to fully complete the assignment but have decided to turn in what I was able to do within the time limit.  I utilized Jquery to help with the async calls for data retrieval and the dynamic portion of the app.  I was a little confused in displaying the data or just using the returned filtered data to display the proper message, so I went with what the assignment called for more in the README markdown which to my understanding was to print out the lines in the examples.  

Thanks for taking a look at this.

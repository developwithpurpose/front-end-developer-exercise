As I started this project, I studied the mockup and how I would set up the project correctly. Seeing the updated requirements, I tried to steer away from an JavaScript. The project is built with html and css, there is also a jQuery plugin that helped me creating the tabs for the Baby Steps. (https://jqueryui.com/accordion/)

I struggled toward the end with some spaceing issues in the tabs. I followed the mockup guidelines but something is keepign them from showing correctly. I think it has to do with the ui bullets, which are hidden by ```list-style-type: none;```

I took the first 3 hours and came up with a good foundation for the project. I hope to use the last hour to work on the AJAX request.  

I also see where I could use the (app/assets/images/header.jpg) then input the text overlaid on the banner but unfortunately, I ran out of time. 

Thank you for allowing me to do this exercise and show my progress since my last submission! I appreciate your time! 

Sincerely,
Matt Henley

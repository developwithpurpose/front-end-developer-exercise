Breif Explaination:
-------------------

First of all, thank you for taking your time to review my work. I tried to keep in simple and efficient.  I have used NotePad++ editor for this project.

CSS
-------------------
CSS for body, header, and content are standard.  Top-text, top-middle-text, and top-bottom-text are added to overlay title texts on header image. 
Text can be moved anywhere on the image. I have added side navigation tabs with sidenav-tab. Side navigation tabs should work on any browser 
without JavaScript turned on.  I have used original blue icons.  I have added greyscale filter for non-selected tabs icons.  
For spacing purpose, I have added big, middle, and bottom paddings. Last part of CSS is the animation for the tabs.

HTML & JavaScript
-------------------
The header section is for header image and overlay texts.

The middle part is for tabs and tabs content for the body.  I have also added tabs animation section for this part. 

Last part is JavaScript. I have pulled data from Json file with jQuery.  I know it is not working as expected.  I was told that I needed to finish it within 4 hours. 
I could have fix it if I had more time.

Thanks again for evaluating my work.  I have read a lot about Ramsey Solutions and I would very much like to join your team.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Saidur Rahman

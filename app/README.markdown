============================

This was a blast!

Was going to run Babel as a transpiler, but time was running out. You'll see a  lib.js file that was going to hold my article content, but I was not able to hook up import/export for es6 in time.

It's been awhile since I've used jQuery. I typically develop in Angular 4 and React, so this was a bit of a throwback.

Thanks for reviewing!

- created initial page header
- created side nav 
- with js, got side nav functioning correctly. i.e toggling content
- styled navigation to match mockup
- created initial content for each step
- styled content to match mock up
- refactored js to cash dom variables where repeating
- cleaned up js, css, and html to be semantic and as intuitive as possible
- ran accessibility test on html
- tested non-js functionality and added in hover state to nav to help with non js users
- Completed documentation of process

This was a wonderful exercise, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. If I had had a time limit longer than four hours, I would of added spec testing, and added a more dynamic non js experience, specifically hide and displaying body content as opposed to navigating the user to the content on click. This was challenging for me as I am used to working in scss, and mobile first approach. Thank you for your time and this opportunity.

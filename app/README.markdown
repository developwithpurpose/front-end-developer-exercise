Front-end Developer Exercise
============================

Style
------
For this project I went ahead and used plain css. It has a pretty small footprint and thought it was best. I broke it down into each section of the page.

-	header
-	navigation
-	content
-	icons
-	fonts

Wanted to group items together so it was fairly easy to go back and find styles when needed.

Javascript
------
I used Jquery and Lodash to solve the problems for this app. 

I wanted to make small functions that did one thing and one thing well. Hoping to make it easier to debug.
I created a setup() that would run once the page was ready to setup all the base code. From there once a user clicked on the step they wanted to view it would pass the index to a few helper functions to move the nav highlight and step to the correct place.

*When Javascript is disabled the site will work and function save for the friends text*

HTML
------
I sadly hand wrote the html as well. Nothing super special here but you will see that it is semantic and accessible.

Thanks
------
Wanted to say Thank You for the fun challenge! It was realy enjoyable to use only a handful of libs and write everything again. I really enjoyed making it.

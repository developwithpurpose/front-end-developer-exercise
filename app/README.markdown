Dylan Gregory's Submission
============================

Being fairly limited with tools and time - which, I understand is the goal - I tried to just be as verbose with what I was doing as possible. Particularly with the JavaScript and getting dynamic content displayed to the screen. There are definitely more 'clever' ways of going about it, but being clear about what is going on is usually better when working with and collaborating with other people. JavaScript it not at all needed to navigate to each of the separate baby-step detail links, which I accomplished by using HTML with bookmarks, utilizing # navigation and anchor tags.

Though the transition example didn't show a need or requirement of hover states, I added those in the nav bar simply because I think they add to the usability and user experience, however small of a detail it is.

I had a lot of fun working on this and brushing up on my vanilla JavaScript (though I did use some jQuery).

Document your submission here (optional, but recommended)

So this is my second submission after receiving an email last week from Josh Sikes.  

As far as the project goes:

I picked up from where I left off on the last submission.  Even though there were changes to the 
instructions, I felt that most of the work I had done before still applied.  The main things I focused
on were cleaning up things that I could see.  I also attempted to create a CSS file with CSS3 transitions
and transformations to meet the criteria for having the app work without js.  I was not as successful 
in doing this as I would've liked.  I resorted to just showing everything and keeping the menu in a 
fixed location (which looks horrible).  But I valued the function over the look.  

Overall, I feel okay about the submission.  I believe the core is good, and I could've focused on so
other ways to improve the work from my previous solution, but I chose what I chose, and ended up doing
what I could to the project as best as I could at this time. I definitely enjoyed getting back into
a heavier project to remind me of where I am now, and where I'd like to be. Thank you for the opportunity.

### Header area

Added main header area to get things started. Style refinements to come.

### Main area

Added main section, as well as navigation for baby steps that includes light vanilla JavaScript
to handle setting active state.

### Content navigation logic

Added JavaScript to handle hiding and showing content based on 'click' of side navigation item. It makes sense to have
a single, concise function that declaratively iterates over the nav items to handle both highlighting the active item and displaying the correct copy based on matching the index of the current active nav item and the index of the correct copy item.

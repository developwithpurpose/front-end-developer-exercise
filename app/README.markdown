For the CSS, if this was a larger codebase, each group will have its own dedicated scss file, i.e. header.scss, typography.scss, but in the essence of time, I did not create a build process to concatenate the sass
For the navigation, based on the information at hand, assuming the content is static, I used the pseudo selector to assign the image, rather than create a class for each one. If the content is dynamic, I would have assigned classes and maybe even converted the images to SVG files, so I could use "icomoon" to convert them to font-icons, which would give us more flexibility and less loading time which helps with performance. I haven't used sprites in years, so I honestly could not remember the tricks.
For the JSON dynamic content, I simply ran out of time. I left in code of where I was headed. I got stuck trying to gather the count of the number of friends in each baby step, in order to display the correct messaging.

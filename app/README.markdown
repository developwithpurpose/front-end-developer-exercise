**Hello and thank you for this awesome opportunity!**

I stared this project by cloning the files from your github repo via command line.
First I added an index.html file, secondly I added styles.css, main.js files and made sure they were linked correctly.
After that, I attacked the project piece by piece and added the jqery library and google fonts to the head of the index.html file.


My first task was to make sure the tabs worked and onLoad the default tab was "tab 1".
Second I made a ajax get request to baby-steps.json and via dev tools made sure the data was being pulled in.
After that I wrote a for loop in order to loop through all the objects in the array.
I then grabbed the objects array position and used that to write my if statement.
I then appended the html to the appropriate tab id.
I then finished the project by styling and adding the header img and body copy.

Thanks again for this project and your time. I look forward to hearing from you regarding any next steps.

All the best,
Ryan Graham

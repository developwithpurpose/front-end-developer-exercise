style.css contains all styling.

script.js contains all javascript.
    Jquery hosted on google's servers.

    Image switching is done in javascript when a new stage is selected. If javascript is disabled, menu images will remain the same color. 
    There is a new ajax request whenever a new stage is selected to get most up to date friend information.
    

I ran out of time, but here is what I would have done -

    I would have fixed the friends feature to only show 2 friends plus the number of other friends.
    I would have fixed the first step friend info not loading on page start.
    I would have added animation to the menu. I maybe would have done more with the main animation.
    I would have fixed some general styling - especially making sure all the numbers were accurate.

Thank you for your consideration it was a fun and challenging project!

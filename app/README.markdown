Front End Developer Exercise
========

Following your guidelines I recreated the "mockup.jpg" you provided. Thank you for providing such detailed instruction, it really made this a smooth process. I completed most of the project, however, ran out of time before I was able to make it usable without JavaScript. I intended to go back once I had it all working to complete the part of the project, however, I didn't want to go over the four hour time limit.

Features
--------

- Simple illustration of the seven baby steps to get out of debt
- Uses jQuery to navigate through the steps
- Utilized "animate.css" for simple transitioning between the steps
- Uses a custom jQuery AJAX call to get a JSON list of friends in each step to display on screen
- Included Node SASS for SCSS preprocessing

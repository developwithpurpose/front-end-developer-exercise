the icons:
I would use svg fonts like fontello or something like that. That way it is just a svg font and not have the overhead of sprites or individual images. 
There is also the ability to change the color in css.
Time constraints does not allow for this, so I just used individual icons.


button gradient not in ie9

dynamic data:

ok honestly I spent way too much time on punctuation. I was trying to be slick and ran out of time. 
In real world I probably would not do this this way. 
I was trying to get everything in one trip to the server and not doing server calls on each button click. 
There would be discussion o which way to go. There are pluses and minuses to both. My thought was that it is not much data so just get it all and use jQuery or whatever to 
place it and put it where we want it.

It would probably be better to do it on clicks. 

Like I said I ran out for time for the coloring but it would just be a class added to the div. I would probably use jQuery .html() to add the data.
That way I could have a set html/css structure when appending the data...

Sorry I ran out of time.

I am going to redo this on my own just because it was fun.

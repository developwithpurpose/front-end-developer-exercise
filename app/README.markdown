###Front-end Developer Exercise


My personal goals for this assignment:

1. Replicate the mockup accurately

2. Use clean, semantic HTML markup

3. Use vanilla javascript to complete the dynamic functionality


I feel that I was successful in these areas and I (almost) finished in the 4-hour window. Given more time, I would have simplified and optimized the javascript code for the JSON/AJAX section. I also feel that using a "functional programming" approach would be benefitial for that section because it would be more modular than in its current form.

EDIT 9/17: I forgot to mention that I used SASS to compile the CSS and Babel for the Javascript. The source files for both can be found in the 'build' directory.


Thank you so much for this opportunity and I look forward to speaking with you further!

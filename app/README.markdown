A web page providing information about The 7 Baby Steps to financial freedom by Dave Ramsey

The page uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery. To run it

* run 'npm install', 'npm start'
* point browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Notes

* Have not used header image with text header_text.jpg, instead used css

* Have not used heading_bs1.png and other body headings imiges, instead used css

* Have tested in Chrome 70.0.3538.110, Firefox 63.0.3 and Safari 11.1 on macOS 10.13.4

* Tested IE 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 using Safari Develop > User Agent menu option. Do not have
access to Windows box

* Have tested with Javascript disabled in Firefox. When javascript is disabled
removing menu as it is not usable, changing style to make page look better

* Not sure where friends names to link to, for example, "Kimberly Lopez, Joseph Lopez ..."

To Do

* Possible that there is no logic to display friends on first load on Step 1 if there were any
in json file. Test it and verify this scenario

* Improve on css, clean it, for example, line up large icon and header text

* Verify the pixels distances requirements are exact as in annotated-mockup.jpg

* Improve on page layout on window resizing

* Improve the slideshow effect

* Add gradient color transition on menu

* Add shade images provided with the exercise to the edges

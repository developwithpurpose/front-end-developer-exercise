Layout is fairly simple and easy to implement. Not used to having to text for anything lower than IE 10 currently so there may be some limitations to some of the CSS I wrote.

I did not set up any CSS preprocessor as it was a small exercise and not neccessary to complet the exercise and would have just added time and a not essential step. I am used to running with gulp or compass though. I used Psudeo elements for the icons instead of extra html elements as they are just decorative elements and not needed for a11y standards.

JS was the hardest part of this excercise as it is a weaker coding language for me. Though I was able to eventually figure out the firends section.

This will work without JS as seperate pages.

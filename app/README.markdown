Thanks for reviewing my submission! This was a great challenge and still has got me pushing my skills.

Notes:
- I chose to do a fade as the animation.
- I chose to raise the content text from 13px to 15 px because it seemed to match the resource images a bit better.
- The most challenging part for me was the dynamic content. I think I have the code to where it meets the requirements, but I do realize that the scripting can be summarized a bit better, alas, I have run out of time.
    - In my opinion the perfect code would have a variable that counts the remaining friends a bit differently and I think the verbage logic could be revisited.



-Thanks again! And I hope this find you well. The PR's for GitHub are a bit new for me. If there is an issue with my branch or if you need changes from me please let me know. :)

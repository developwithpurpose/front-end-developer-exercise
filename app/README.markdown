I used HTML / CSS / JavaScript.

In reworking my original attempt, I changed how I put in the side nav bar and how it functioned. With a click function, I used toggle to simplify and link what was being shown for the click event.

I added animation to the icons for when they are hovered over, which causes them to rotate.

I also cut down and tried to change up how I was using ids and making them into classes instead. I also took out the <br> and changed them into p tags to allow the break instead. I limited the amount of div tags as well to when they were only necessary.

Overall, I feel good on how I reworked it well. I would love to explore more ways on linking the people in step with the toggle function.

Front-end Developer Exercise
============================

by Aaron Moradi

npm Scripts
-----------
- prestart
	- runs "gulp"
		- compiles less, adds browser prefixes, minifies, renames, and pipes to destination
		- concatenates JS, uglifys, renames, and pipes to destination
		- minifies hml5shiv.js and pipes to destination
		- lints JS 
- start
	- starts server and listens on port 8080
- lint
	- lints JS

Remember to run:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```
to install the devDependencies.

Styles
------
- these are composed in less
- modular, by component, element or variables
- rules are in alphabetical order

JS
--
- main Baby Step tab script is exposed and namespaced in the global DaveRamsey object (this was chosen over an anonymous function to better faciliate unit testing)
- jquery, a 2 feature modernizer build, and html5shiv are the vendor scripts

Masthead
--------
- background image and HTML text were chosen over just an `<img>`
- for better site-wide design unity, accessibilty, and SEO

Baby Steps Tabs
---------------
- the component is coded as page anchors
	- this enables off page linking to specific steps
	- non JS functionality
	- and tabbing navigability
- icons are background images, utilizing the spritesheets and limiting http requests
- tab transitions are done with CSS3 transitions and animations. A jQuery fallback is also present for browsers that don't support CSS transitions and animations.
- friends in the dynamic summary user story were composed in blue in the mockup, but because they are not links, they are not blue. Link styles are present in the CSS though.

When JS is turned off
---------------------
- when page anchor (or hash) is not present, 1st tab does not look "active" but content is initialized correctly
- 1st tab animation is not exactly the same as the rest (but close)

Jasmine Unit Tests
------------------
- these can be found at [http://localhost:8080/jasmine/jasmine-standalone-2.4.1/SpecRunner.html](http://localhost:8080/jasmine/jasmine-standalone-2.4.1/SpecRunner.html)

Accessibility
-------------
Various [ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles) were added to the html for added accessibility concerns.

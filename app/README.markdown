Front End Developer Challenge Markdown - Wes Arnold - wes.arnold@gmail.com

1. Initial layout was done using Bootstrap. 

2. After the layout was done and the styling was completed using the image resources provided I spent the remainder of my time working on the .JS portion of the Challenge.  I used the image asset with the text included for the top image as responsive design was specifically mentioned as not important.  If I was coding in my usual style, responsive design would be a priority and I would have styled all the text and made the images responsive as well.

3. I planned on adding animation classes to the menu and content transitions and I wrote out the basic CSS and Javascript for the animations but didn't have time to incorporate it into the final product and test it within the time allotted.  I left the code in just to show my intentions.

4. As you can see by the main.js, my javascript skills to be modest at best and I tend to to use .svg image format for the versitility and the ability manipulate them using CSS.

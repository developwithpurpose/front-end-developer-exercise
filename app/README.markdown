Document your submission here (optional, but recommended)

Hello,

Thank you for the opportunity to take on this challenge. Here are a few notes:

1 - I was unable to complete the dynamic content part. Javascript is not really my strongest skill and I ran out of time before I could even attempt it.

2 - I did the menu navigations with Bootstrap JS Tab.

3 - I used the header_text.jpg file for the header. This is not really ideal for SEO purposes, but used it to save some time.

4 - I added a few css details like a border top to the menu so it would not mesh with the white up top.

Thanks Again

Josue Colon

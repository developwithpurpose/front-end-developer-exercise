## CSS
> Basic animation for the tabs. I decided to used stripes for the load and bandwith, having built a lot of banners over my carreer, we were always trying to use less bandwith and calls to the server to minimize the load on the customer.

## Javascript
The page functions normal with javascript disabled. It won't load the friends if javascript disable, so in that case I am checking to see if javascript is disable and not displaying the friends on steps, so it won't mislead the person.

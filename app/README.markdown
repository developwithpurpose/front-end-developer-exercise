The non-javascript version just lists all the baby-steps in one page. Menu still use anchor targets to navigate.
Possible to use :target attribute to show one item at a time, but not implemented.

All JSON is loaded when the document loads.

I ran out of time before styling the friend names. Also, first line of top header does not look like the mockup.

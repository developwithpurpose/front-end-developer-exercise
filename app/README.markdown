I used HTML / CSS / JavaScript.

I tried to be really dry when it came to HTML / CSS so it would not get messy when referring to ids in javascript.

As I got towards the end, I realized multiples ways I could have made my javascript a lot more dry and not so lengthy. However, this is the code that I came up with in order to complete the exercise.

To pull the JSON data in, I simply used an XMLHttpRequest. I then pulled the data into arrays based off of what baby step the user was on. If in the future, data was being added to it. The people in each step will update.

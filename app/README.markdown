Front-end Developer Exercise 
============================

1. I used CSS only tabs instead of Javascript so the effects of using the tabs would still work even if Javascript was disabled on the browser. CSS transitions are faster to write and more performant than Javascript. IE9 doesn't support transitions. To save on time I intentionally ignored this problem but it could be resolved in the future by applying Javascript. 
2. I used HTML text for the banner image for better SEO instead of the image with the text already in it.
3. I used individual icon images intentionally to make it disabled friendly and give it a good SEO.


I hope you like the code! ^.^

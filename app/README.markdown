Review

Hello!  Thank you for the opportunity to interview for the front-end developer position.  It took me 3 hours and 40 minutes to complete
what I have submitted.  I wanted to complete this README with the final 20 minutes.

This was a fun exercise.  I am happy with the results.  I would have loved to include the dynamic content as well but ran out of time.
I also would love to work more on the user's interaction with displaying the baby step content.  Currently, the user will see multiple babysteps if they click on multiple babystep buttons. I really would have liked to hide all other babysteps when the user clicks on one babystep button.


Thank you!

Brandon Kissam Developer Exercise - JavaScript Developer position
=================================================================

Comments
--------

First of all, thank you for taking the time to review my submission. Here is what I want you to know regarding my submission:

* I first tried to make the website with absolutely no JavaScript at all to make sure it would work as expected once I turned it off. I initially used checkboxes to create the selected appearance of the lists and to show the baby steps. This worked well, however, it was not very accessible.

* To make the page accessible, I started using links within my list elements and using the :target pseudo-class to make the baby steps appear. Without JavaScript, there is an abrupt jump to the top of the baby step which I do not like, but I did not find a better way of doing it without using JavaScript. However, the user could then tab through the list, press enter, and see the baby steps! I also opted to include text in the header picture so it could be read by screen readers.

* I added the JavaScript after that to make the transitions, the selected appearance of the list, and to get the JSON. I used a combination of of jQuery and vanilla JavaScript purposefully to show I can work with frameworks when necessary but I can also use plain JavaScript. I started out building my own frameworks to accelerate my understanding of JavaScript.

* I normally comment my code, lately using YUIDoc, and run tests using Jasmine but it looked like all comments go here. I also did not see it necessary to use LESS/SASS for this project or any JavaScript minifiers/uglifiers.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Thank you again for this opportunity. I am blessed to have had it and I can take away many things from this experience already. Just through doing this exercise I learned many things about web development such as how to make sites/apps accessible. I hope this meets with your standards and I am very impressed with the personnel you have working for you since they were able to accomplish this task.

Firstly, Thank you. Though my finished product may not look like it, I was able to learn a lot from this challange. Given my experience and the alloted time for this exercise, I was a bit intimidated. However, once I was able to break it down I decided to start with the dynamic story. I broke it down even smaller and was able to pull data from the JSON file (a small victory). I began to tackle the logic and once I got to the point where everytime I googled something, the first 4 results were already purple, I decided to put the rest of my time into the styling. 

The experience was invaluable and I will definitely be gearing my studies towards some of the topics this exercise introduced to me, such as writing semantic and accessible html. 

I will also be continuing to work on this project in my spare time until I come to a finished product I am happy with.

Thank you for your time!

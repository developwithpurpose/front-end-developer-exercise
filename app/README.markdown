## I got this far in the allotted 4 hours. 
I was not able to

* finish adding all of the content for the baby steps
* complete the scrolling for baby steps
* add the animation for navigating between baby steps
* add the dynamic content

I'll admit a lot of the styling took much longer than I anticipated. The front end work that I do now as a full stack appliation developer mostly involves collecting/sorting/manipulating data, making AJAX requests, throwing toast messages, and creating screen flow logic.

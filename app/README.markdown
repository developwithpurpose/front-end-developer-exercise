## About

This project re-creates the Ramsey Solutions mockup into a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript application.

![Mockup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DrianHillman/front-end-developer-exercise/master/resources/mockup.jpg)

#### HTML

I normally use semantic HTML tags however this is not supported by early versions of IE (per the project's specifications)â€” therefore, I used standard Div elements & descriptive classes.

#### CSS

I coded the CSS without any modern pre-processors or SASS to keep it simple.

#### JavaScript

For the JavaScript I implemented common design patterns and coded this in a modular way with object-literal notation; in practice, this is helpful for larger applications.

> One of my favorite resources while coding Vanilla JavaScript & JQuery is [this book by Google's Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)!

## In Summary

This project is successfully complete! However, I wish I could spend more time optimizing for the JavaScript-disabled fringe case.

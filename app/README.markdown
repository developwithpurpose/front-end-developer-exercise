-Added node-sass to allow use of sass.

-Used noscript tags to allow for non-js browsing.

-Scrolling animation uses jQuery's animate method.

-Ran out of time before finishing up the dynamic content loading feature.  I intended to jQuery's load method and parsing the json object for each related baby step.

-Also, I used the provided baby step header images and hero with the text included.  Was running low on time, but would have preferred to not have included the text as part of the image to prevent it from blurring.

-Regarding styling, I like to use flex and rems, but decided on pixels to be sure to match the spacing in the mockup.

Notes:

To solve the no javascript constraint, there is repeated Nav in each html view,
with more time would make this more like a single page application

Yep, repeating code across 7 html pages is time expensive - should have come up with a solution
with one page and dynamic body



Timing:

1 hour of setup (I did not count this towards the project, these were things I needed to do anyway)
0 - 2 Hours - HTML Scaffolding - site is navigable with content, no styling
45 minutes to go - Got stuck, app is not loading files, probably a file directory issue (quick break, then will find a solution)
                 - Took a break to workout and regroup
Final Update
    App is incomplete, it sill needs the Ajax loading, and all stying
    Some impediments that slowed me down: new hardware, new git client, used to single page application using angular
    Lessons Learned:
        Would have spent more time on setup and research before setting the challenge
        I'm rusty, and need to improve developing with a process and more planning
        In a real life scenario would negotiate for more time, it's not worth rushing and doing a poor job
        I'm happy to continue this, or try again. Thanks!

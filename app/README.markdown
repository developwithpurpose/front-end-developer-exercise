I have created a 7 Baby Steps web page with the  requirements. Given a 4 hour time span to complete the project, there is still much room left for improvement. The project has attempted several requirements as provided in the documentation such as:
1. I have written this web site using JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML.
2. The website utilizes the provided assets, such as a header image and navigation bar icons.
3. There is an animation when navigating between each of the baby steps.
4. It makes use of a Node.js web server and can be deployed on localhost:8080.
5. When each Baby Step is clicked, you will see which friends are also on it. This capability is made possible using AJAX and JSON.
6. The mockup has been consulted, and given the strict timeframe of completion, only some of the styling has been completed. The CSS can be expounded upon to give the website a much more complete feel.
7. The body copy of only 1 Baby Step will show at a time, while the others will be hidden.
8. There are bugs that will need to be corrected, such as the first click on Baby Step 1 is not recognized. Another bug is that the animation is jittery, and needs styling.
9. Per the documentation, the website is not responsive.
10. The JavaScript code needs to be rewritten in a more concise manner to give the documents better code organization. DRY principles could be implemented to achieve this.
11. A Single Page Application framework was not used to complete this web site.
12. No comments were used. All comments are kept here in the README file.

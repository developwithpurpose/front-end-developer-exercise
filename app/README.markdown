#Jacob Allen | Front End Developer Exercise

Overview
---
This exercise is intended to showcase my knowledge of web technologies and best practices.  While I'm relatively new to the industry, I trust you'll find I have a solid foundation upon which I'm eager to build.  

As cited in the instructions, I intentionally left out any comments in my code other that what is necessary for readability (i.e. html section separators).  I have also included a SASS table of contents to aid in searching the stylesheet.  All other documentation and comments will be found in this document.

Technologies used
---

In addition to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I used the following technologies:

+ [SASS](http://sass-lang.com) - CSS preprocessor
+ [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - CSS and JavaScript library
+ [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - JavaScript Library
+ [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) - Open Sans and Source Pro Sans fonts
+ [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Server scripting to run the API

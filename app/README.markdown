This web page was built using Chrome. It will work in other browsers, but will look the best in Chrome.

I added a small 2px line above Baby Step 1 in order to make it look more pleasing when it was selected.

Because of the way I wanted to Dynamically show and animate the different steps, the web page will not be
as practical without JavaScript.

Everything dynamic was performed using jQuery and AJAX.

Thank you

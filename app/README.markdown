#Code Challenge Notes

First off, I wanted to say thank you for the opportunity to apply for this job.  I understand that there were not any junior designer positions available, which is what I feel my skill set is more suited towards, so I understand that I still have areas that need growth in relation to a front end developer position.  Coming from that position, I currently am unfamiliar with AJAX or any Javascript frameworks for that matter, with the majority of my understanding being in HTML, CSS, and knowing how to use already made Javascript plugins.  However, I am eager to learn them if I get the job.  That being said, here are some notes on my code challenge submission.

The majority of the HTML and CSS are pretty straightforward.  I used a JqueryUI plugin to create the tabs and control which of the Baby Steps appeared on the screen at a time, and used CSS to animate them fading in.  

As for the shadows on the sides of the main content area of the page, since the main content area has a set width and since this page is not supposed to be responsive, I combined both of the shadows into one image file and set them as the body background to simplify having to insert them with HTML.

For the icons on the tabs in the navigation panel, I decided to adjust the images themselves with padding to position them.  

Other than that, everything should be fairly plug and play as far as CSS and HTML goes.

Once again, I thank you for this opportunity to do this code challenge, and look forward to hearing from you.

## Notes

Thank you for reviewing my submission of the Front End Developer exersise. I very much enjoyed working on it! Below are notes on the project.

Features include sidebar navigation that renders content witbout the use of JavaScript, a transition between the rendered content, a change in the state of the navigation buttons during an event and JSON data rendered asynchronously.

Features still to be added include a background with border images and rendering of specific JSON properties. These features would haven taken more than the allowed time to complete, however I look forward to completing them in the future as an exersise.

Resources used include W3Schools, Dev.to, W3Docs, MDN Web Docs, CSS-Tricks, Stack Overflow

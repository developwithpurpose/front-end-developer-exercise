###Front-end Developer Exercise


My personal goals for this assignment:

1. Replicate the mockup accurately

2. Use clean, semantic HTML markup

3. Use vanilla javascript to complete the dynamic functionality


I feel that I was successful in these areas and I (almost) finished in the 4-hour window. Given more time, I would have simplified and optimized the javascript code for the JSON/AJAX section. I also feel that using a "functional programming" approach would be benefitial for that section because it would be more modular than in its current form.


Thank you so much for this opportunity and I look forward to speaking with you further!

I decided to use raw JS instead of a library like jQuery. Since most project do not require jQuery because of the new CSS3 properties, I thought it
would be prudent to just use raw JS. In most of my project, I used raw JS. Of course some of the newer JS is more elegant when you do not have to support IE9.

I also used raw CSS. I my normal work flow I would use SASS, but since this is a new project with a time constraint, I decided to just use CSS. Plus it lets you know how I normally organize my CSS.

I declared 'main' as a block level element because older versions of IE require this.

I got started on the 'Dynamic Content' section, but ran out of time to finish it. 

Unfortunately, my animations are somewhat rough. With more time, I could polish them.

#Ran out of time:
- The shadow on the navigation is off. The 'Dynamci Content' secton is imcomplete. The content area images were supposed to be blue. The animation needs to be reapplied on each page navigaton.
- I would have cleaned up my code (especially JS further).

My thoughts were that each of the links would point to a full page (work without JS). Then JS would disable each link and then dynically replace the content if JS is enabled.

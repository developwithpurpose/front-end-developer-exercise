Every piece of the exercise was coded from scratch except for the JQuery carousel, used to created to slide animation.

The JQuery plugin is 'Amazingcarousel-5' (https://amazingcarousel.com/examples/jquery-carousel-id5/)
This plugin was not purchased but ripped of this demo site and refactored to fit the exercise's needs.

The Ajax call to the 'baby-steps.json' is located at the top of the 'javascript.js' file and has its own code comments.

The node_modules for npm folder is not added. You will need to 'npm install' before you 'npm start'.

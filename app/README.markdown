Document your submission here (optional, but recommended)

First, I thank you for you consideration of me for a position with Ramsey Solutions. I strongly feel that this is the type of company that I want to work for. I feel like, if given the opportunity, that I can learn quickly from the experienced developers you already have and fill a role with the comapny. As I discussed in my first interview, my skills are somewhat limited but I am commited to developing further and working hard to do that. 

This is the first time that I have really developed a web page from complete scrach so some of the tasks I was not able to figure out in the 4 hour time limit. I had to look up a lot of how to style and position things correctly. I think a lot of what I could not complete, I would have been able to if I had someone I coud consult with. I am very much a visual learner, so while I am able to use other resources to help solve a problem, I do best when having an actual person walking me through. 

I started out by using JS functions to interact with the side nav but then remembered that the page needed to run without JS so I used pure CSS to do that. I used Bootstraps grid system to help structure that content. I have a few external stylesheets and one that I coded myself to be more specific on the the requirments of the project. 

I discovered a few different ways to make the AJAX call and display data, but I ran out of time before I could learn how to pull them from the JSON file for display. I think I was able to come up with the logic behind grabbing that information, sorting it based on the 'baby-step', and then displaying it to the correct step in the html. Again, I ran out of time before I could figure out how to do that correctly. 

I had planned on submitting the project much sooner but my work was delayed due to some other stuff I had going on involving my move to NAshville in August. I mostly spent this past week working on the project. 

Again, this type of development is very very new to me to it was a huge learning curve. I hope that we can move forward in the process and would be thrilled to have the chance to work with the company. I can assure you that what I lack right now in skill, I will more that make up for by working extreamly heard, listening and learning every chance I get, and being a complete team player. I feel that all I need is a chance to learn and grow in a healthy enviorment like Ramsey Solutions. 

 Thank you again for this opportunity.
 
 -Sean Pettus.

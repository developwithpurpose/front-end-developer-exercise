Thank you for the opportunity to work through this exercise. This was a really fun challenge to do while keeping to the 4 hour time constraint.

My goal with this exercise was to have as much functional as possible and meet the requirements as best I could. With more time, I would definitely refactor my javascript to be leaner, improve the baby steps animation, clean up some of the whitespace in the HTML and improve my CSS so that my page is more exact to the provided annotated mockup.

I didn't have time to complete the baby steps animation to match the example, so I chose to just do a simple fade out and fade in.

While a did a few quick checks, I wasn't able to do comprehensive cross browser testing, so I kept my HTML and CSS fairly straight forward and conservative.

I used jQuery for this to facilitate the animation and make the ajax call simpler. Normally I get jQuery from the CDN link and then provide a fallback to a jQuery min hosted with the project, but that was a low priority with this project given the time and I chose to use the safer jquery file within the project.

Thank you again for the opportunity to work through this exercise. If you have any questions about my work, please contact me.

Sincerely,
Greg Stewart

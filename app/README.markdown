#Code Challenge

## HTML
In my current role, I understand the importance of structural hierarchy of a page's content, and attempted to maintian a clear hierarchy of content within the markup. I also attempted to keep the markup as semantic as possible for clarity of purpose. Where there was copy that was not visible in the mockup, I included the copy in the html and hid it with a CSS clip. To build hide/show tab functionality, I used 'radio' button input labels that corresponded with content divs and required no external scripting. 

## CSS
In addition to the main.css style sheet, I included a standard reset.css to normalize browser stylings.

I made use of sprites for some of the icons to reduce network loads, and included transitions and features that worked across different browsers. I also attempted to avoid using images for effects when CSS features could be used instead (such as box shadow and text placement over an image). 

## JavaScripts
While I use JavaScript for tooling and automation in my current role as a developer, I haven't worked with AJAX requests and had a difficult time writing a function that would handle the JSON data and write the "friends" status in each "Baby Step" content block. 

## Deployment
I minified both the HTML and CSS files for increased performance in deployment.

// = Thank You!
// • I know that the interview process can be be daunting for all parties involved, so
// thank you for your time to review this web page and your consideration. This was a
// fun little page to build under the 4-hour time constraint.
//
//
// = Browser Display Deviations
// • Since I am using OS X, I am not able to test in a native Internet Explorer browser 
// other than some free services that are available online. As such, I am not able to
// 100% verify that display is correct in Internet Explorer.
//
//
// = Javascript
// • I decided to use Javascript to set the "active" status of the navigation items, and
// let CSS handle the animation for the different Baby Steps. This allows the page to
// still work without Javascript enabled.
// • The Dynamic Content requires Javascript to run, so disabling Javascript will cause
// this feature to become non-functional.
//
//
// = Dynamic Content
// • Due to time constraints, I decided to take the instructions literally by copying 
// and pasting the exact text that was provided and displayed it based on the friend 
// counters that were built. 
// • I did not pull names from the JSON file.
// • The links that are displayed for each friend simply links to "#".

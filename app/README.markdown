Front-end Developer Exercise
============================

## HTML

* Used BEM to help with specificity in styling
* Broken down into three sections

1.  Header
2.  Sidebar/Nav
3.  Paragraph Description

## CSS

* Used standard CSS
* Reset all Margin and Padding to 0 and box-sizing to inherit/border-box
* Would usually use SASS but since it wasnt a big project decided to use specificity from the BEM method
* Was unable to get border shadows to work properly with the border-image property

## JavaScript

* Used jQuery to help with some of the more difficult DOM manipulations
* Used webpack to bundle and load compiled JS into dist folder for production
* Used babel-polyfill with webpack to make sure javascript would work in older browsers
* Was not able to get the friends to load the correct amount of names/people on the babystep selected.
* Was unable to toggle between gray/blue icon images

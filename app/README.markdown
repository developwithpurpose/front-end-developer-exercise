-- NOTE TO THE DEVELOPERS --
Before I started this project I had little to no knowledge of AJAX and how to use JSON files. Although this excersize has been a huge learning experience for me,
I must appologize that I have not learned enough. Due to my inexperience, I was unable to write the code to complete all the tasks laid out in the dynamic content challenge.
That being said, I hope that you will still consider me for the position of Front-End Developer. I enjoy tasks that challenge me because it causes me to grow and develop
as a person. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing your feedback and critique of my work.

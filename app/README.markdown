## Thanks.

Thank you for letting me tackle this challenge, it was both fun and difficult to get everything in 4 hours.

## Getting it running
- `npm start`

## CSS

- I decided to go with CSS Variables because it helps a ton with colors especially.
- The reason you see color twice is to give the browser a fall back that doesnt suppose css vars.

### Andrew Skinner Code Challenge ###

This project was definitely a challenge for me as I have not worked on projects like this yet.

My projects so far have been about manipulating data and the front-ends have had 0 input from designers.

Overall, it was a fun experience and I really learned a lot from it.

#### Notes ####

Some things that I was not able to accomplish due to time constraints were:
  * Testing the site in multiple browsers
  * Ensuring that the site would work the same without any javascript

Some things that I would have also do to improve the page moving forward
  * Use webpack to bundle assets
  * Use Babel to convert javascript
  * Seperate out code into smaller re-useable components
  * Use css variables
  * Use a more creative animation


My main focus was on making sure the display matched the mockup and the functionality was smooth.

#Notes: 
- Added node-sass to allow use of sass.

- Used noscript tags to allow for non-js browsing.

- Added a fun text loading effect to hero on page load.

- Also, I used the provided baby step header images with the text included.  Was running low on time, but would have preferred to not have included the text as part of the image to prevent it from blurring.

- Regarding styling, I like to use flex and rems when building something responsive, but decided on pixels since that was not part of this exercise and to be sure to match the spacing in the mockup.

- Ran out of time before finishing up the dynamic content loading feature.  I intended to parse the json object for each related baby step and append the relevant friend message.

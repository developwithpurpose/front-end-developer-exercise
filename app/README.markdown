This was a great project. It had a wide dynamic range of possible approaches, as well as running the gamut from design to logic.

I opted for gradients, shadows or text where appropriate, and used the minimum amount of provided images necessary, using correct semantics as best I know how, to be as performant and accessible as possible.

Classes and IDs are named with teamwork, collaboration and approachability in mind, so they speak to their meaning and content.

The scripts are written for modularity and extensibility, so as not to be painted into a corner were the site to grow, change or expand. All functionality and styling is relevant and usable with scripting disabled, except the dynamic friend content (of course).

There may be more performant, elegant, cleaner ways to implement the desired dynamics. I am only 4 months in to programming and getting better every day!!

Deviations

* In the main.js file I have tried numerous solutions to make the friends summary show relative to how many friends are assocaited with each Baby Step. I've went through creating a function, switch and a nested for loop and was unable to output the necessary output according to the summary. I know how to create switches and for loops but may need some guidance and helping me understand how to better access a JSON file to get each babyStep key and it's value. I've tried getting the length and correspond the length to a certain number so that it would output the right way, but kept getting an error in the console of the browser.

* Another struggle I had was trying to keep the animation from jumping back to BabyStep 1 when I put in the code to prevent default browser behavior. I've did a lot of research as to why the animation seems to jump back to one if you go from Baby Step 1 to 4 and try to go to 3 it jumps back to one. So seems to be something I'm missing in my code to somehow set the selected step and reset the animation order or something.

* One other thing I couldn't seem to figure out to how to do is changing that image of the button icon to blue once selected. I've had a few ideas on how to do this and possibly add '-on' to the id of the selected button once the 'current' class was added to a list item.

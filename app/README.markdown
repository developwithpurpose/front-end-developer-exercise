# Ford Henley Front-End Developer Code Challenge!
This is the code challenge for Patrick Ford Henley

## My Comments
* I focused mmy 4 hours on created a perfect render of the provided mockups. I am not a Photoshop expert and usually work with provided assets so I was not able to export the icons. I used Font-Awesome to replace them.

* I used a CSS3 grow effect for the menu animation

* I was not able to get the fonts to render on my machine. I had to purchase helvetica and I used google web fonts for the Sans Pro.

* I typically work with Twitter Bootstrap for a fast workflow but you seemed adament that we not do a responsive version so I used the 960 grid based on the mockup.

* I did not have enough time to work out the Ajax request. Honestly it is something that I do not have to do a lot but I am willing to learn. I would like to really learn how to be a better Front-End dev since I am self taught. I learn quickly!

* I hope I covered everything you needed and I look forward to speaking with you soon!

* Ford Henley

##First look over the annotated-mockup and break it down into sections.

    3. Content Body. 
        A. Navigation.
        B. Baby Steps.
    4. Friends Section. 
    
    
### Overall Layout 
Based on the image provided I assumed that the page needed to take up about 90% of the page with a grey bg #bbbfc2, but the content section show have a white background.

### Header
The header section was pretty straight forward. Add the image to the page and take up 100% of the available width. Instead of adding a padding to the bottom of the Header or added padding to the top of the Baby Steps content section, I decided to create div that would fill the requirements for adding a 60px padding between the two elements. 

### Content Body
#### Navigation

# Leo Taylor - Jr. Front End Developer Challenge for Ramsey Solutions!

#### I found this challenge both fun and challenging. I felt very tempted to push on beyond the 4 hour time limit, but it appears time has expired. However, I am happy with my progress.

## Challenges
- The greatest challange for me was showing and hiding the baby steps descriptions without JavaScript. My initial thought was to use display: none, and display: block to show and hide based on the sidebar click. After struggling for what felt like long enough, I chose to move on, quickly make it work with jQuery, and come back to this feature. Unfortunately, I hit the 4 hour time limit before I could really dive into it. I am confident that with additonal time, I could have nailed this down.


## Version 2.0
- Use CSS and HTML to replicate the functionality of selecting a babystep and use cooler tranisition animations that don't rely on jQuery.
- Responsive Design.
- Remove dependence on global variable in main.js (line 126)

## Take aways
- As an indiviual that enjoys working with CSS more than most, I was surpised to stuggle with the showing and hiding of baby steps without javascript success criteria.
- I chose to use jQuery to combat the 4 hour time limit. Even though it has been roughly a year since I last used jQuery, picking it back up was a breeze.

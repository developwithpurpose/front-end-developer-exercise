Front-End Developer Excercise


This is web application that shows the 7 baby steps to financial peace.

This is a Node app. CSS Grid is used for layout. 
All fonts are contained in project.

Run:

npm install (installs dependencies)
npm start   (starts web server)

My Experience Doing This Exercise
==================================

It took a little longer than I had hoped, but I learned CSS Grid for this project. It turned out pretty well I think. I liked having a professionally annotated layout to work with. I included all the appropriate fonts in the project so there would not be any issues on other platforms. I matched the colors but they look slightly off. The hex values in the CSS file are right though. Maybe it was a browser issue.

I did this project on my Linux box using VS Code. My windows laptop was complaining about not being able to render the index.html. I reinstalled the npm packages, but I think my laptop has a virus. It works locally.

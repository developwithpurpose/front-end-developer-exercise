Front End Developer Exercise
========

I developed this web-page using Chrome, but I did use Safari's "User Agent" feature to simulate other browsers. Using this feature the web-page appeared to be presentable on all browsers. In my experience Safari does a good job at simulating other browsers, but occasionally there are deviations.

I used jQuery's built in Ajax calls to meet the Ajax criteria.

Deviations
--------
* Although I found ways to swap the current step using pure HTML and CSS. I found it much more graceful to perform this with Javascript.
* I also performed the animations with Javascript.
* As stated in the "Success Criteria" section, Javascript was used for the "Dynamic Content" exercise.

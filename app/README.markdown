###Summary
I finished all the major feature components. I will say having to check what CSS is compatible with IE9
was a definite challenge. I am very familiar with FlexBox/CSS Grid and having to go back to positioning/floats was 
challenging. The biggest things you will notice is that the styling isn't an exact match to the provided 
annotations but close. 


###Pure CSS Navigation Menu
I ended up using jQuery here to create a quick active/inactive navigation menu and to switch the article content.
I know this can be done purely with CSS/HTML, but I couldn't finish it with that approach in the alloted time.

### Sorting of the readers
I am not completely satisified with my algorithm for sorting/appending the active readers per article,
however for the small dataset given it will work. With 1000's of records, it will definitely need to be optimized.


###All Code in one file
I never write my code in one file. I like to use separation of concerns to put things where it is appropriate but with
the given time and lines of code I needed, it was a lot faster to write it all in the index.html file.

Enjoy! =)

In order to save time, I have chosen to utilze the images that include the text.  If/when time allows, I can replace the images with those without text, and then manually add text over the images in order to be more flexible with changes.

Utilizing JQUERY to animate transitions

I am focusing more on making the code work, have it look correct on the screen.  The code really needs to be refactored if there's time at the end.

I have run out of time.  There is a 4 hour limit.  Things that still need to be done:

1. Change background color of the buttons after they are selected.
2. Change the font color of the buttons after they've been selected.
3. Fix spacing issues.
4. Query the JSON data and have the correc data appear on the screen when each item is selected.

Front-end Developer Exercise
============================

Objective
---------

Build a web page that will provide information about The 7 Baby Steps.

Explanation
------------

I have completed the exercise using basic html and css skills.  Other than jQuery and lodash I did not use any other library or build tool.

I have attempted to keep all the class and id names as obvious as possible.

In order to maintain cross-browser compatibility I made a complete html page for each of the 7 baby steps.  I created a views folder for the html file so as to organize the project.

I used basic CSS as much as possible and avoided using the jpgs for shadows - the one exception being the bottom shadow.  The images would make it impossible to resize the browser window without ruining the layout of the page.

I believe all requirements were met.

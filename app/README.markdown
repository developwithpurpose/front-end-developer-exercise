As I started this project, I studied the mockup and how I would set up the project correctly. Seeing the updated requirements, I tried to steer away from an JavaScript. The project is built with html and css, there is also a jQuery plugin that helped me creating the tabs for the Baby Steps. (https://jqueryui.com/accordion/)

I took the first 3 hours and came up with a good foundation for the project. I hope to use the last hour to work on the AJAX request.

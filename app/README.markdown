Document your submission here (optional, but recommended)
It pains me to deliver something to you which I consider incomplete (I see minute details which I *know* should be there if this were total requirements during a push to production and end-users), but in the interest of the interview process and expediency, this is what I am submitting. Intitially, I was told to spend no more than 4hrs on it, but after seeing the scope of the page, styling, tech needed, etc, that clearly wasn't to be the case, since I had to build everything from the ground up. :), But I also want to balance my time and get this back to you. While my example could use some tweaks, deeper dives on data manipulation, etc., I do believe I have demonstrated that I know how to work within the environment and stand something up rapidly...my comments were just some general notes/thoughts that I wrote down during the process.  

- Building out the page, generic HTML style, getting the framework of the page down first.
- Adding resources such as style sheets, fonts, scripts, etc.
- Using sprite method for nav button image and mouse over actions
- Use relatively easy to read id and class names
- Tab for Baby Step 1 has some odd issue with an inline style of display block being injected.  worked a simple handler to get around it without some further exploration as to what the issue is with it, inline style being injected somehow. Tabs function as expected, however.
- Use XMLHttpRequest, low weight, non-library import, from W3School.
- Search through JSON to find the baby steps with associated tab
- Brute force clearing of the active sprites
- Toggled javascript on/off.  I would build out an alternative <noscript> set of divs that have just simple hard-coded objects, but I feel like I am running out of time as-is...
- There is a TON of consolidation that I can do in my CSS and scripting to clean things up quite alot and I know where those areas are, but again, in the interest of time...modularize the code so it is easier to read and also REUSE.
- Transitions can also be built in after functionality is solidified. I have included a basic spinner that could easily be executed during JSON/server requests once everything is functionally fit.
- Able to pass the tab clicked into the JSON parser, to then use it to search through JSON to pull back only what is necessary.

I will be glad to discuss all of the options I chose, and perhaps there are even better ways to do things, i.e. "if statements" versus using "case statements" - I'm a team player, open, and willing to use best methods and practices.  Thank you for the opportunity and looking forward to discussing things further!

Html & Css
The hardest part of this phase was getting the floats right.

At first I wanted to use CSS3's Flexbox, but it is not supported
in older browsers.

I wanted to have everything right float wise, but inorder to stay 
within the time frame I found a nice stopping point. 

JavaScript
I read that your DevTeam no longer uses jQuery in the stack, but for
the sake of time I was forced to swtich from using purely javascript
to a mixture of both javascript and jQuery.

I use 5 functions:

startingStep: Takes a number of the baby step you wise to default to.

highlightStep: Highlights the current step that was selected.

getJson: Takes the url of a json file and returns its data.

dynamicSort: Use along with sort() to sort by the key that is given.

currentStepFriends: Returns how many friends are on the current step.

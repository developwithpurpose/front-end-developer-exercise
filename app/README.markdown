The trickiest part (and one of the most interesting parts) of this project was the open-endedness of the animation direction. I didn't want to just copy what the mockup was doing, so I modified the look of the page to display all the steps, and then scrolled to those steps if you clicked on them.

I liked this approach because of its simplicity, but also beacuse there wasn't a whole lot of difference between this look and the look when javascript is disabled.

I also enjoyed researching, implementing, and manipulating the data in the json file. Hadn't done that before and enjoyed learning the process. Thee biggest struggle was figuring out a way to iterate over all the steps dynamically.

Tested in IE11, Firefox 44, and Chrome 48

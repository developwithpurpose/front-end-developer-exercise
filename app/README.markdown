Preprocessor/Build Tool

* I used w3schools.com's vertical tab template and built from there. The code can be found here: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_vertical_tabs

* I attempted to make a transition between the baby steps but was unable to figure it out in the allotted (suggested) 4 hours. I'm still going to try to figure it out for my personal development.

* I aslo could not figure out how to make the content dynamic. That, too, will be a part of my personal development that I will contiune to try.

* Instead of using the graphics for the baby step tabs, I used font awesome.

* I thoroughly appreciated the challenge :)

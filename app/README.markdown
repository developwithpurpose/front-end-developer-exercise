#  Front-end Developer Exercise

## index.html

Since the requirements required the page to work without javascript, I decided against hiding any of the baby step content and decided to add padding so someone without JS could still access all the Baby Steps by clicking on the nav menu. Normally, I would put the index.html in the root folder, but chose to left it where it was from the clone.

## main.js

I chose to utilize the main.js to meet the requirement of using an animation for navigating between the baby steps and switching the icon images when a Baby step is selected. (*This was the hardest part of the challenge for me*)

## dynamic.js

To stick somewhat to the Single Responsibilty Principle I am doing the ajax call is this file. In order to sort and filter the data from response, I populated an array with the response.

## styles.css

The only deviation I am aware I made in styling is not using the Helvetica font because I don't have it and would have to pay to use it.


## Filenaming

I did rename the javascripts folder to scripts and stylesheets to styles.

# Front End Developer Exercise

A forked copy of the coding challenge worked to the best of my abilities for the time alloted, according to the information received.

## Getting Started

Copy the repo to your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You can use Git to run the application.  


### Installing

Install Node.js to use as your local server:
- npm install

To start the server:
- npm start

With the server running, you can view the app on your browser on port 8080:
- localhost:8080

### Notes About The Exercise 
My biggest challenge for this exercise was time.  Given more, I would have completed the following:
- correcting layout issues: positioning per mockup
- adding animation to navigation
- adding dynamic message to page - the app.js file successfully reads in the json file data, and sorts the data in ascending order alphabetically.  It also is set to read in the step number that the visitor chooses from the click event in the navbar -- and then will filter the array of friends to find those on that same step.  The results need to be written to the page, according to the message format specified - logic for this task was started but not completed.

## Acknowledgments

* Thank you for the opportunity to attempt your coding challenge.  Although I was unsuccessful in completing the challenge, I had fun doing the work and I was once again inspired by Dave Ramsey's Baby Steps as I worked with the copy for the page.  So, while I was unsuccessful in my attempt, I consider this a successful endeavor by the inspiration I received/will take away from this.

I was told to only take 4 hours on this test, but I lost track of time and took a little bit more.

I guess I am a little rusty on my jquery and had trouble creating the slider and manipulating the JSON. 

Things I need to finish:

Tighten up the CSS and move it to an external file.

Merge the Slider script and GetJSON script to work in the same file 
and have them trigger of the same event in the babystep panels. 

modify the jQuery that manipulates the baby-steps.json file.

Make the website more accomadating to other browsers. 

make the small icons turn blue when selected.

After my first attempt, I wanted to work on this again and show my front-end skills.

I created the page with html, css, and javascript. I could not figure out how to create a smooth transition between steps so I used a jquery plugin that I found online for the transition. 

The JQuery plugin is from - (http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/)

The Ajax call to the 'baby-steps.json' is located at the top of the 'main.js'

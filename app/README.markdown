## Resources

Bootstrap was used mainly for layout.

## Styling

I used Roboto in place of helvetica due to helvetica not being available as a google font, but left helvetica as the first font of that font stack.

## Directions

No other packages will be needed to view. I only used bootstrap, html, css, and vanilla javascript to build the page.

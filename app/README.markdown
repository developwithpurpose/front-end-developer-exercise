1. Attatched the banner, adjusted in CSS
2. Added Navbar, adjusted in CSS
3. added styles to navbar, to make it white when selected page is loaded
4. added pages 2-3 in HTML, since you'd like the page to be loadable without Javascript

Skipped to working with Javascript, because of time. Upon researching and coming to no conclusion on how to access the json database, I was determined and attemped to access the array of objects in databaseHandler.js until I hit the 4 hour time limit.

~NOTES: Thank you for letting this humble beginner attempt this coding challenge. You've motivated and encouraged me to keep learning. :)

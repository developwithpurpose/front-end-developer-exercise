### Hello there, great challenge!

### Overall, I am satisfied with the end result.

However there are a few things that I should have done that I did not do.
* I spent a little more time on getting the Friend's List rendered properly, since it was listed a priority. I noticed after I completed that should have formated the appended friend's differently to get the proper css class for just the names.
* I was unable to change the font color and icon on the tabs.
* I would have resolved this effect by either doing a hover effect or hasClass.
* Tab-content Transition, I spend some time researching best practices to achieve this using JQuery. I ended up using the bootstrap fade-in class to give it a smooth transition. 
* I added animate css package that I intially planned of just adding the classes to the .active tab-pane.

### Background
I have been in the tech industry since October 2015. I am a full time product manager and support. I started coding around December 2015 working on simple html and css. I started a side project that was a Django/RESTfull/html/css SaaS. So I have learned the these languages from asking questions to friends, and searching google, docs, and stackoverflow. I was able to get the side project to BETA release in 1 year with the assistance of 1 partner. I wanted to build the skills to assist engineering at my full-time job to meet deadlines, innovate new products, and improve the overall user experience.
For the past couple months at my full-time job I have been working 4 8hr days coding.I am fairly new to using js frameworks, I have been writing and learning AngularJs for the past couple months, but still have a lot of understanding to do. I have been using this framework to render data via RESTful services, improve user experience, and create a modular platform with one other front-end developer. I still have a lot to learn, but I learn quickly when I have the opportunity to be involved with new practices. 

### Thank you for the opportunity and Looking forward for the feedback

Front-end Developer Exercise - Jennifer McGoldrick
==================================================

Objective
---------

Build a web page that will provide information about The 7 Baby Steps.

Requirements
------------
* Forked the repo to my [Github account](https://github.com/jsmit032/front-end-developer-exercise "github account").
* Followed the mockup requirements as closely as possible, with the required google fonts, and efficient CSS file, with headers of various id's and classes.
* Completed the "Dynamic Content" when javascript is enabled. Figured I'd have to set up the server for dynamic content without javascript

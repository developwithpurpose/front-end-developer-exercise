Without javascript, the nav does not appear, because it would not make sense to have it.  The buttons work through javascript and would be useless with javascript disabled.  Also, the Baby Steps all appear when javascript is disabled.

In script.js, the first 20 lines deal with adding the nav and hiding non-current Baby Steps.  the makeRequest() function lists the friends on each Baby Step, and clicked() is the function called when a button in the nav is clicked.

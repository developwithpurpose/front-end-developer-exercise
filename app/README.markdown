### My Deviations
--------------

#### 1. Text Color 

I changed the color from `#36abe1` to `#2FACE1` on the nav links because the requested color was darker than the .png image file that was provided.

#### 2. Responsive

Though not fully mobile responsive I went ahead and added a few media queries because the width of the browser affected the height of the nav and "main" wrapping div not to match. 

#### 3. More JavaScript

I used a click function to add and remove the class `.highlight` for the links on the side bar. I was running out of time to figure out how to switch the highlight of an active link with CSS only.

For my submission I decided to do as much with CSS and HTML as possible and use as little JavaScript as possible. JavaScript is only used for the AJAX requests as well as adding a active class on the side items and sliding the items up and down. I am sure I could have used a keyframe animation in CSS, but due to time I decided agaisnt that approach. The page works in all browsers (including IE9) and works when JavaScript is disabled. When JavaScript is disabled showing and hiding the divs is done by the anchor tag target method. My transition is different than the one given in the example. I am just sliding the divs up and down with jquery based on the side nav item. Other than jquery the only other library I included was Skeleton.css. I used this just for the two column layout. I have always used skeleton for my frontend projects so adding that and using it was very quick for me. If you have any other questions feel free to email me brooksjeremy76@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing for you guys!

Cody Loggins Front End Developer Exercise

Working Hours - 6/6/19 7:30pm - 10:00pm CST

I would like to start off by saying that Iâ€™m sad with my performance with this challenge, but I believe that this is a fair reflection of my skills with limited time, research, and no outside help.
My code relies heavily on bootstrap and I am using the 3 CDN scripts for CSS, JQuery, and JS.
I had particular issues with styling, and I have left a fair amount of styling different from the mockup to give it a better cohesive look (in my opinion).


If I was given more time/resources, I would love to do the following to enhance this project
- Better CSS & remove inline styling
    - I know the inline styling works, but I would rather have a working CSS file for consistent styling/cleaner code
- Implement some kind of framework
    - I would prefer Angular because of my experience, but I would like to split up the code into more reusable components
- Custom JS
    - I would have loved to attempt other ways of doing the tabs and not relying on bootstrap as much


Thank you for the opportunity, and I believe that this code challenge has given me real incite to my coding knowledge.

If it isn't too much trouble I would love to see the actual code that you were looking for because I know that my code is very sub-par from what you normally get.

## Front-End-Developer-Exercise Submission##

### Getting Started ###

  1. Clone the Repo.
  2. Run `$ npm i` and `$ npm start` in the directory to install dependencies and serve the app (using Node 7.7.4).
  3. Navigate to `localhost:3333/` in your browser to view the project.


## Notes ##

  - I began to run out of time for the 4 hour limit, so I wrapped up and submitted as is.
  - I did not get to:
        - Animating the menu/content scrolling when clicking thru the steps
        - Scrollspy that has the menu following the user's manual scroll thru page
        - The Dynamic User Story
        - Tiny styling cleanups
  - I chose to use Brunch to build the project, as it's leaner and meaner (read: faster) than Grunt or Gulp.

Thanks for the chance to try this out. I can continue working on this if desired, and submit changes in another PR.

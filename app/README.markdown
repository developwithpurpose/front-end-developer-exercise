## Develop with a Purpose

Notes:

1. Tabs and tab-content are built to function on css alone, but jQuery is used to apply and remove active class styling for a better experience.

2. Icons were toggled from default to active using background-image css changes.

3. jQuery was also used for the JSON GET request and objects were pushed to an empty array (friends) to be stored as regular javascript array.

4. Using a simple javascript filter, I used nested switch statements to get the babyStep of each friend and compared that with the length of the filtered results to determine how many friends were on the same step.

5. For this project, I used a sass-autocompile package for the Atom text editor.
  a. Styles are kept in assets/stylesheets && contains two directories for original sass files and the compiled/minified stylesheet.

If that's the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.</p><p>The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick wins in order to stay pumped up about getting out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It's about motivation. Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior.

Your answer to that question is how much you should save.</p><p>Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a major impact on you and your family.

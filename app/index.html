                                    <h3>$1,000 Emergency Fund</h3>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <p>An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can’t plan for: the
                                loss of a job, an unexpected pregnancy, a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on
                                and on. It’s not a matter of if these events will happen; it’s simply a matter of when
                                they will happen.</p>

                            <p>This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies from turning into new debt
                                while you work off the old debt. If a real emergency happens, you can handle it with
                                your emergency fund. No more borrowing. It’s time to break the cycle of debt!</p>

                                    <h3>Pay off all debt using the Debt Snowball</h3>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest balance should be your
                                number one priority. Don’t worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar
                                payoffs. If that’s the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.</p>

                            <p>The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick wins in order to stay
                                pumped up about getting out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s
                                about motivation. Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When you
                                start knocking off the easier debts, you will see results and you will stay motivated to
                                dump your debt.</p>

                            <p>Once you complete the first two baby steps, you will have built serious momentum. But
                                don’t start throwing all your “extra” money into investments quite yet. It’s time to
                                build your full emergency fund. Ask yourself, “What would it take for me to live for
                                three to six months if I lost my income?” Your answer to that question is how much you
                                should save.</p>

                            <p>Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a major impact on you and
                                your family. Keep these savings in a money market account. Remember, this stash of money
                                is not an investment; it is insurance you’re paying to yourself, a buffer between you
                                and life.</p>

                            <p>When you reach this step, you’ll have no payments—except the house—and a fully funded
                                emergency fund. Now it’s time to get serious about building wealth.</p>

                            <p>Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax
                                retirement plans. Don’t invest more than that because the extra money will help you
                                complete the next two steps: college savings and paying off your home early.</p>

                            <p>By this point, you should have already started Baby Step 4—investing 15% of your
                                income—before saving for college. Whether you are saving for you or your child to go to
                                college, you need to start now.</p>

                            <p>In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to have a goal. Determine how
                                much per month you should be saving at 12% interest in order to have enough for college.
                                If you save at 12% and inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead of inflation at a
                                net of 8% per year!</p>

                                live!</p>

                            <p>Golda Meir says, “You can’t shake hands with a clenched fist.” Vow to never hold your
                                money so tightly that you never give any away. Hoarding money is not the way to wealth.
                                Save for yourself, save for your family’s future, and be gracious enough to bless
                                others. You can do all three at the same time.</p>

                </header>
                <p>An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life
                that you can’t plan for: the loss of a job, an unexpected
                pregnancy, a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on and
                on. It’s not a matter of if these events will happen; it’s
                simply a matter of when they will happen.</p>
                <p>This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little
                Murphies from turning into new debt while you work off the old
                debt. If a real emergency happens, you can handle it with your
                emergency fund. No more borrowing. It’s time to break the cycle
                of debt!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step2 hidden">

                    <h3 class="subheading">Pay off all debt using the Debt
                    Snowball</h3>
                </header>
                <p>List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest
                balance should be your number one priority. Don’t worry about
                interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s
                the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.</p>
                <p>The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some
                quick wins in order to stay pumped up about getting out of
                debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about
                motivation. Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80%
                behavior. When you start knocking off the easier debts, you
                will see results and you will stay motivated to dump your
                debt.</p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">3 to 6 months of expenses in
                    savings</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Once you complete the first two baby steps, you will have
                built serious momentum. But don’t start throwing all your
                “extra” money into investments quite yet. It’s time to build
                your full emergency fund. Ask yourself, “What would it take for
                me to live for three to six months if I lost my income?” Your
                answer to that question is how much you should save.</p>
                <p>Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would
                have a major impact on you and your family. Keep these savings
                in a money market account. Remember, this stash of money is not
                an investment; it is insurance you’re paying to yourself, a
                buffer between you and life.</p>

            <div class="step4 hidden">

                    <h1 class="heading">Baby Step 4</h1>
                    <h3 class="subheading">Invest 15% of household income for
                    retirement</h3>
                </header>
                <p>When you reach this step, you’ll have no payments—except the
                house—and a fully funded emergency fund. Now it’s time to get
                serious about building wealth.</p>
                <p>Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into
                Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement plans. Don’t invest more than
                that because the extra money will help you complete the next
                two steps: college savings and paying off your home early.</p>

            <div class="step5 hidden">

                    <h1 class="heading">Baby Step 5</h1>
                    <h3 class="subheading">College funding for children</h3>
                </header>
                <p>By this point, you should have already started Baby Step
                4—investing 15% of your income—before saving for college.
                Whether you are saving for you or your child to go to college,
                you need to start now.</p>
                <p>In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to
                have a goal. Determine how much per month you should be saving
                at 12% interest in order to have enough for college. If you
                save at 12% and inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead
                of inflation at a net of 8% per year!</p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Pay off your house early</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Now it’s time to begin chunking all of your extra money
                toward the mortgage. You are getting closer to realizing the
                dream of a life with no house payments.</p>
                <p>As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much
                like you did back in the second step of the debt snowball.
                Remember, having absolutely no payments is totally within your
                reach!</p>

                    <h3 class="subheading">Build wealth and give!</h3>
                </header>
                <p>It’s time to build wealth and give like never before. Leave
                an inheritance for future generations, and bless others now
                with your excess. It's really the only way to live!</p>
                <p>Golda Meir says, “You can’t shake hands with a clenched
                fist.” Vow to never hold your money so tightly that you never
                give any away. Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save
                for yourself, save for your family’s future, and be gracious
                enough to bless others. You can do all three at the same
                time.</p>

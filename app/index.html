                <h4>$1,000 Emergency Fund</h4>

              <div class="description">
                <p>
                  An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that
                  you can’t plan for: the loss of a job, an unexpected
                  pregnancy, a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on and
                  on. It’s not a matter of if these events will happen; it’s
                  simply a matter of when they will happen.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies
                  from turning into new debt while you work off the old debt. If
                  a real emergency happens, you can handle it with your
                  emergency fund. No more borrowing. It’s time to break the
                  cycle of debt!
                </p>

                <h3>Baby Step 2</h3>
                <h4>Pay off all debt using the Debt Snowball</h4>

              <div class="description">
                <p>
                  List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest
                  balance should be your number one priority. Don’t worry about
                  interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s
                  the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some
                  quick wins in order to stay pumped up about getting out of debt!
                  Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about motivation.
                  Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When
                  you start knocking off the easier debts, you will see results
                  and you will stay motivated to dump your debt.

                  Once you complete the first two baby steps, you will have built
                  serious momentum. But don’t start throwing all your “extra”
                  money into investments quite yet. It’s time to build your full
                  emergency fund. Ask yourself, “What would it take for me to live
                  for three to six months if I lost my income?” Your answer to
                  that question is how much you should save.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a
                  major impact on you and your family. Keep these savings in a
                  money market account. Remember, this stash of money is not an
                  investment; it is insurance you’re paying to yourself, a buffer
                  between you and life.

                <h4>Invest 15% of household income for retirement</h4>

                  When you reach this step, you’ll have no payments—except the
                  house—and a fully funded emergency fund. Now it’s time to get
                  serious about building wealth.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth
                  IRAs and pre-tax retirement plans. Don’t invest more than that
                  because the extra money will help you complete the next two
                  steps: college savings and paying off your home early.

              <div class="description">
                <p>
                  By this point, you should have already started Baby Step
                  4—investing 15% of your income—before saving for college.
                  Whether you are saving for you or your child to go to college,
                  you need to start now.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to
                  have a goal. Determine how much per month you should be saving
                  at 12% interest in order to have enough for college. If you save
                  at 12% and inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead of
                  inflation at a net of 8% per year!

                  Now it’s time to begin chunking all of your extra money toward
                  the mortgage. You are getting closer to realizing the dream of a
                  life with no house payments.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much like
                  you did back in the second step of the debt snowball. Remember,
                  having absolutely no payments is totally within your reach!

                <p>
                  It’s time to build wealth and give like never before. Leave an
                  inheritance for future generations, and bless others now with
                  your excess. It's really the only way to live!
                </p>

                <p>
                  Golda Meir says, “You can’t shake hands with a clenched fist.”
                  Vow to never hold your money so tightly that you never give any
                  away. Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save for
                  yourself, save for your family’s future, and be gracious enough
                  to bless others. You can do all three at the same time.

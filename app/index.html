                    <p>An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can&#39;t plan for&#58; the loss of a job&#44; an unexpected pregnancy&#44; a faulty car transmission&#44; and the list goes on and on. It&#39;s not a matter of if these events will happen&#59; it&#39;s simply a matter of when they will happen.</p>
                    <p>This beginning emergency fund will keep life&#39;s little Murphies from turning into new debt while you work off the old debt. If a real emergency happens&#44; you can handle it with your emergency fund. No more borrowing. It&#39;s time to break the cycle of debt!</p>

                    <p>List your debts&#44; excluding the house&#44; in order. The smallest balance should be your number one priority. Don&#39;t worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that&#39;s the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.</p>
                    <p>The point of the debt snowball is simply this&#58; You need some quick wins in order to stay pumped up about getting out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It&#39;s about motivation. Personal finance is 20&#37; head knowledge and 80&#37; behavior. When you start knocking off the easier debts&#44; you will see results and you will stay motivated to dump your debt.</p>

                    <p>Once you complete the first two baby steps&#44; you will have built serious momentum. But don&#39;t start throwing all your &#34;extra&#34; money into investments quite yet. It&#39;s time to build your full emergency fund. Ask yourself&#44; &#34;What would it take for me to live for three to six months if I lost my income?&#34; Your answer to that question is how much you should save.</p>
                    <p>Use this money for emergencies only&#58; incidents that would have a major impact on you and your family. Keep these savings in a money market account. Remember&#44; this stash of money is not an investment&#59; it is insurance you&#39;re paying to yourself&#44; a buffer between you and life.</p>

                    <p>When you reach this step&#44; you&#39;ll have no payments&#45;except the house&#45;and a fully funded emergency fund. Now it&#39;s time to get serious about building wealth.</p>
                    <p>Dave suggests investing 15&#37; of your household income into Roth IRAs and pre&#45;tax retirement plans. Don&#39;t invest more than that because the extra money will help you complete the next two steps&#58; college savings and paying off your home early.</p>

                    <p>By this point&#44; you should have already started Baby Step 4&#45;investing 15&#37; of your income&#45;before saving for college. Whether you are saving for you or your child to go to college&#44; you need to start now.</p>
                    <p>In order to have enough money saved for college&#44; you need to have a goal. Determine how much per month you should be saving at 12&#37; interest in order to have enough for college. If you save at 12&#37; and inflation is at 4&#37;&#44; then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net of 8&#37; per year!</p>

                    <p>Now it&#39;s time to begin chunking all of your extra money toward the mortgage. You are getting closer to realizing the dream of a life with no house payments.</p>
                    <p>As you attack this last debt&#44; you will gain momentum much like you did back in the second step of the debt snowball. Remember&#44; having absolutely no payments is totally within your reach!</p>

                    <p>It&#39;s time to build wealth and give like never before. Leave an inheritance for future generations&#44; and bless others now with your excess. It&#39;s really the only way to live!</p>
                    <p>Golda Meir says&#44; &#34;You can&#39;t shake hands with a clenched fist.&#34; Vow to never hold your money so tightly that you never give any away. Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save for yourself&#44; save for your family&#39;s future&#44; and be gracious enough to bless others. You can do all three at the same time.</p>

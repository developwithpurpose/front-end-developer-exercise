            <h2>Baby Step 1</h2>
            <h4>1,000 in an Emergency Fund</h4>
            <p>In this first step, your goal is to save $1,000 as fast as you can. 
                Your emergency fund will cover those unexpected life events you can't plan for. 
                And there are plenty of them. You don’t want to dig a deeper hole while you’re 
                trying to work your way out of debt!</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Baby Step 2</h2>
            <h4>Pay off all non-mortgage debt using the Debt Snowball</h4>
            <p>Next, it’s time to pay off the cars, the credit cards, and your student loans. 
                Start by listing all of your debts except for your mortgage. Put them in order 
                by balance from smallest to largest. This is called the debt snowball method, 
                and you’ll use it to knock out your debts one by one.</p>

            <h2>Baby Step 3</h2>
            <h4>3 to 6 months of expenses in a Fully Funded Emergency Fund</h4>
            <p>You’ve paid off your debt! Don’t slow down now. Take that money you were 
                throwing at your debt and build a fully funded emergency fund that covers 
                3–6 months of your expenses. This will protect you against life’s bigger 
                surprises, like the loss of a job or your car breaking down, without slipping 
                back into debt.</p>

            <h2>Baby Step 4</h2>
            <h4>Invest 15% of household income into Retirement</h4>
            <p>It's time to get serious about retirement—no matter your age. Take 15% 
                of your gross household income and start investing it into your retirement. 
                Start with your company’s 401(k) plan and receive the full employer match. 
                Invest the rest into Roth IRAs—one for you and one for your spouse (if you’re married).</p>

            <h2>Baby Step 5</h2>
            <h4>Fund college for children</h4>
            <p>By this step, you've paid off all debts (except the house) and started saving 
                for retirement. Next, it's time to save for your children’s college expenses 
                (that is, if they make it through Algebra II and Chemistry unscathed). We 
                recommend 529 college savings plans or ESAs (Education Savings Accounts).</p>

            <h2>Baby Step 6</h2>
            <h4>Pay off your home early</h4>
            <p>Now, bring it all home. Baby Step 6 is the big dog! Your mortgage is 
                the only thing between you and complete freedom from debt. Can you imagine 
                your life with no house payment? Any extra money you can put toward your 
                mortgage could save you tens (or even hundreds) of thousands in interest.</p>

            <h2>Baby Step 7</h2>
            <h4>Build wealth and give a bunch away</h4>
            <p>You know what people with no debt can do? Anything they want! 
                The last step is the most fun. You can live and give like no one 
                else! Keep building wealth and become insanely generous. Leave an 
                inheritance for your kids and their kids. Now, that's what we call 
                leaving a legacy!</p>

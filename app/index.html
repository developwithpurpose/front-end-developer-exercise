          <h3>$1,000 Emergency Fund</h3>

          <p>An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you
          can&rsquo;t plan for: the loss of a job, an unexpected pregnancy, a faulty
          car transmission, and the list goes on and on. It&rsquo;s not a matter of
          if these events will happen; it&rsquo;s simply a matter of when they will
          happen.</p>

          <p>This beginning emergency fund will keep life&rsquo;s little Murphies
          from turning into new debt while you work off the old debt. If a real
          emergency happens, you can handle it with your emergency fund. No
          more borrowing. It&rsquo;s time to break the cycle of debt!</p>

          <h2>Baby Step 2</h2>
          <h3>Pay off all debt using the Debt Snowball</h3>

          <p>List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest
          balance should be your number one priority. Don&rsquo;t worry about
          interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that&rsquo;s the
          case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.</p>

          <p>The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick
          wins in order to stay pumped up about getting out of debt! Paying off
          debt is not always about math. It&rsquo;s about motivation. Personal
          finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When you start
          knocking off the easier debts, you will see results and you will stay
          motivated to dump your debt.</p>

          <h2>Baby Step 3</h2>
          <h3>3 to 6 months of expenses in savings</h3>

          <p>Once you complete the first two baby steps, you will have built
          serious momentum. But don&rsquo;t start throwing all your &ldquo;extra&rdquo; money
          into investments quite yet. It&rsquo;s time to build your full emergency
          fund. Ask yourself, &ldquo;What would it take for me to live for three to
          six months if I lost my income?&rdquo; Your answer to that question is how
          much you should save.</p>

          <p>Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a
          major impact on you and your family. Keep these savings in a money
          market account. Remember, this stash of money is not an investment;
          it is insurance you&rsquo;re paying to yourself, a buffer between you and
          life.</p>

          <h2>Baby Step 4</h2>
          <h3>Invest 15% of household income for retirement</h3>

          <p>When you reach this step, you&rsquo;ll have no payments—except the
          house—and a fully funded emergency fund. Now it&rsquo;s time to get serious
          about building wealth.</p>

          <p>Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth
          IRAs and pre-tax retirement plans. Don&rsquo;t invest more than that
          because the extra money will help you complete the next two steps:
          college savings and paying off your home early.</p>

          <div class="friends-on-my-step"></div>

          <i class="icon icon_collegesavings"></i>
          <h2>Baby Step 5</h2>
          <h3>College funding for children</h3>

          <p>By this point, you should have already started Baby Step
          4—investing 15% of your income—before saving for college. Whether you
          are saving for you or your child to go to college, you need to start
          now.</p>

          <p>In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to have
          a goal. Determine how much per month you should be saving at 12%
          interest in order to have enough for college. If you save at 12% and
          inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net
          of 8% per year!</p>

          <h2>Baby Step 6</h2>
          <h3>Pay off your house early</h3>

          <p>Now it&rsquo;s time to begin chunking all of your extra money toward the
          mortgage. You are getting closer to realizing the dream of a life
          with no house payments.</p>

          <p>As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much like you
          did back in the second step of the debt snowball. Remember, having
          absolutely no payments is totally within your reach!</p>

          <h2>Baby Step 7</h2>
          <h3>Build wealth and give!</h3>

          <p>It’s time to build wealth and give like never before. Leave an
          inheritance for future generations, and bless others now with your
          excess. It's really the only way to live!</p>

          <p>Golda Meir says, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t shake hands with a clenched fist.&rdquo; Vow
          to never hold your money so tightly that you never give any away.
          Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save for yourself, save for
          your family’s future, and be gracious enough to bless others. You can
          do all three at the same time.</p>

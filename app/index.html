Hi.  Thanks for taking the time to look over my code. I'm anxious to hear what you 
think about it.  

I wrote all of this code from scratch, so if there is something that looks goofy, 
it's my own goofiness. I don't have any WYSIWYG tools for web development.  

Enjoy -

Bryce

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can’t plan for: 
                            the loss of a job, an unexpected pregnancy, a faulty car transmission, and the list 
                            goes on and on. It’s not a matter of if these events will happen; it’s simply a matter of when they will happen.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies from turning into 
                            new debt while you work off the old debt. If a real emergency happens, you can handle 
                            it with your emergency fund. No more borrowing. It’s time to break the cycle of debt!

                            <div class="articleSubtitle">Pay off all debt using the Debt Snowball</div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest balance should be your number 
                            one priority. Don’t worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s 
                            the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.
                       </p>
                        <p>
                            The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick wins in order to stay pumped 
                            up about getting out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about motivation. 
                            Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When you start knocking off the easier 
                            debts, you will see results and you will stay motivated to dump your debt.

                        <p>
                            Once you complete the first two baby steps, you will have built serious momentum. But don’t start
                            throwing all your “extra” money into investments quite yet. It’s time to build your full emergency fund. 
                            Ask yourself, “What would it take for me to live for three to six months if I lost my income?” Your answer
                            to that question is how much you should save.
                       </p>
                        <p>
                            Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a major impact on you and your family. 
                            Keep these savings in a money market account. Remember, this stash of money is not an investment; it is 
                            insurance you’re paying to yourself, a buffer between you and life.

                        <p>
                            When you reach this step, you’ll have no payments—except the house—and a fully funded emergency fund. 
                            Now it’s time to get serious about building wealth.
                       </p>
                        <p>
                            Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement plans. 
                            Don’t invest more than that because the extra money will help you complete the next two steps: 
                            college savings and paying off your home early.
                        </p>

                        </div>             
                        <p>
                            By this point, you should have already started Baby Step 4—investing 15% of your income—before 
                            saving for college. Whether you are saving for you or your child to go to college, you need to 
                            start now.
                       </p>
                        <p>
                            In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to have a goal. Determine how much per 
                            month you should be saving at 12% interest in order to have enough for college. If you save at 
                            12% and inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net of 8% per year!

                        <p>
                            Now it’s time to begin chunking all of your extra money toward the mortgage. You are getting closer 
                            to realizing the dream of a life with no house payments.
                       </p>
                        <p>
                            As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much like you did back in the second step of 
                            the debt snowball. Remember, having absolutely no payments is totally within your reach!

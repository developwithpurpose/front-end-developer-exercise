                            <p>An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can’t plan for: the loss of
                                a job, an unexpected pregnancy, a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on and on. It’s
                                not a matter of if these events will happen; it’s simply a matter of when they will happen.
                                <br />
                                <br /> This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies from turning into new debt
                                while you work off the old debt. If a real emergency happens, you can handle it with your
                                emergency fund. No more borrowing. It’s time to break the cycle of debt!

                                priority. Don’t worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s
                                the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.

                                <br /> The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick wins in order to stay
                                pumped up about getting out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about
                                motivation. Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When you start knocking
                                off the easier debts, you will see results and you will stay motivated to dump your debt.

                                built serious momentum. But don’t start throwing all your “extra” money into investments
                                quite yet. It’s time to build your full emergency fund. Ask yourself, “What would it take
                                for me to live for three to six months if I lost my income?” Your answer to that question
                                is how much you should save.
                                <br />
                                <br />Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a major impact on you and
                                your family. Keep these savings in a money market account. Remember, this stash of money
                                is not an investment; it is insurance you’re paying to yourself, a buffer between you and
                                life.

                                <br />
                                <br />Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement
                                plans. Don’t invest more than that because the extra money will help you complete the next
                                two steps: college savings and paying off your home early.

                                save at 12% and inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net of 8%

                            <p>Now it’s time to begin chunking all of your extra money toward the mortgage. You are getting
                                closer to realizing the dream of a life with no house payments.
                                <br />
                                <br />As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much like you did back in the second
                                step of the debt snowball. Remember, having absolutely no payments is totally within your
                                reach!

                            <p>It’s time to build wealth and give like never before. Leave an inheritance for future generations,
                                and bless others now with your excess. It's really the only way to live!

                                <br />Golda Meir says, “You can’t shake hands with a clenched fist.” Vow to never hold your money
                                so tightly that you never give any away. Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save for
                                yourself, save for your family’s future, and be gracious enough to bless others. You can
                                do all three at the same time.

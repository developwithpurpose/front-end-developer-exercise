                An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that
                you can’t plan for: the loss of a job, an unexpected pregnancy,
                a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on and on. It’s not
                a matter of if these events will happen; it’s simply a matter of
                when they will happen.
              </p>
              <p>
                This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies
                from turning into new debt while you work off the old debt. If a
                real emergency happens, you can handle it with your emergency
                fund. No more borrowing. It’s time to break the cycle of debt!

                List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest
                balance should be your number one priority. Don’t worry about
                interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s
                the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.
              </p>
              <p>
                The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some
                quick wins in order to stay pumped up about getting out of debt!
                Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about motivation.
                Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When
                you start knocking off the easier debts, you will see results
                and you will stay motivated to dump your debt.

                Once you complete the first two baby steps, you will have built
                serious momentum. But don’t start throwing all your “extra”
                money into investments quite yet. It’s time to build your full
                emergency fund. Ask yourself, “What would it take for me to live
                for three to six months if I lost my income?” Your answer to
                that question is how much you should save.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a
                major impact on you and your family. Keep these savings in a
                money market account. Remember, this stash of money is not an
                investment; it is insurance you’re paying to yourself, a buffer
                between you and life.

                When you reach this step, you’ll have no payments—except the
                house—and a fully funded emergency fund. Now it’s time to get
                serious about building wealth.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth
                IRAs and pre-tax retirement plans. Don’t invest more than that
                because the extra money will help you complete the next two
                steps: college savings and paying off your home early.

                By this point, you should have already started Baby Step
                4—investing 15% of your income—before saving for college.
                Whether you are saving for you or your child to go to college,
                you need to start now.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to
                have a goal. Determine how much per month you should be saving
                at 12% interest in order to have enough for college. If you save
                at 12% and inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead of
                inflation at a net of 8% per year!

                Now it’s time to begin chunking all of your extra money toward
                the mortgage. You are getting closer to realizing the dream of a
                life with no house payments.
              </p>
              <p>
                As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much like
                you did back in the second step of the debt snowball. Remember,
                having absolutely no payments is totally within your reach!

                Vow to never hold your money so tightly that you never give any
                away. Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save for
                yourself, save for your family’s future, and be gracious enough
                to bless others. You can do all three at the same time. Vow to

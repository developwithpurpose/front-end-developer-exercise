                        An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can’t plan for: the loss of a job, an unexpected pregnancy,
                        a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on and on. It’s not a matter of if these events will
                        happen; it’s simply a matter of when they will happen. This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s
                        little Murphies from turning into new debt while you work off the old debt. If a real emergency happens,
                        you can handle it with your emergency fund. No more borrowing. It’s time to break the cycle of debt!

                        <p>List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest balance should be your number one priority.
                            Don’t worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s the case, then
                            list the higher interest rate debt first.</p>

                        <p>The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick wins in order to stay pumped up
                            about getting out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about motivation. Personal
                            finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When you start knocking off the easier debts,
                            you will see results and you will stay motivated to dump your debt.</p>

                            fund. Ask yourself, “What would it take for me to live for three to six months if I lost my income?”
                            Your answer to that question is how much you should save.</p>

                        <p>Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a major impact on you and your family.
                            Keep these savings in a money market account. Remember, this stash of money is not an investment;
                            it is insurance you’re paying to yourself, a buffer between you and life.</p>

                        <p>Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement plans.
                            Don’t invest more than that because the extra money will help you complete the next two steps:

                            now.</p>
                        <p>In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to have a goal. Determine how much per
                            month you should be saving at 12% interest in order to have enough for college. If you save at
                            12% and inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net of 8% per year!</p>

                            for your family’s future, and be gracious enough to bless others. You can do all three at the

            <p class="copy-body-baby-step">An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can’t plan for: the loss of a job, an unexpected
                pregnancy, a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on and on. It’s not a matter of if these events will
                happen; it’s simply a matter of when they will happen.
                <br> This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies from turning into new debt while you work
                off the old debt. If a real emergency happens, you can handle it with your emergency fund. No more borrowing.
                It’s time to break the cycle of debt!</p>

            <p class="copy-body-baby-step">List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest balance should be your number one priority. Don’t
                worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s the case, then list the higher
                interest rate debt first.
                <br> The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick wins in order to stay pumped up about
                getting out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about motivation. Personal finance is
                20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When you start knocking off the easier debts, you will see results and
                you will stay motivated to dump your debt.</p>

                <br> Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a major impact on you and your family. Keep
                these savings in a money market account. Remember, this stash of money is not an investment; it is insurance
                you’re paying to yourself, a buffer between you and life.</p>

                time to get serious about building wealth.
                <br>Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement plans. Don’t invest
                more than that because the extra money will help you complete the next two steps: college savings and paying
                off your home early.</p>

            <p class="copy-body-baby-step">By this point, you should have already started Baby Step 4—investing 15% of your income—before saving for college.
                Whether you are saving for you or your child to go to college, you need to start now.
                <br>In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to have a goal. Determine how much per month you
                should be saving at 12% interest in order to have enough for college. If you save at 12% and inflation is
                at 4%, then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net of 8% per year!

                the dream of a life with no house payments.
                <br>As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much like you did back in the second step of the debt
                snowball. Remember, having absolutely no payments is totally within your reach!

            <p class="copy-body-baby-step">It’s time to build wealth and give like never before. Leave an inheritance for future generations, and bless
                others now with your excess. It's really the only way to live!
                <br>Golda Meir says, “You can’t shake hands with a clenched fist.” Vow to never hold your money so tightly that
                you never give any away. Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save for yourself, save for your family’s
                future, and be gracious enough to bless others. You can do all three at the same time.

                                <p>An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can’t plan for: the loss
                                    of a job, an unexpected pregnancy, a faulty car transmission, and the list goes on and
                                    on. It’s not a matter of if these events will happen; it’s simply a matter of when they
                                    will happen. This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies from turning
                                    into new debt while you work off the old debt. If a real emergency happens, you can handle
                                    it with your emergency fund. No more borrowing. It’s time to break the cycle of debt!</p>

                                    one priority. Don’t worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar payoffs.
                                    If that’s the case, then list the higher interest rate debt first.</p>

                                <p>The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick wins in order to stay
                                    pumped up about getting out of debt! Paying off debt is not always about math. It’s about
                                    motivation. Personal finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When you start knocking
                                    off the easier debts, you will see results and you will stay motivated to dump your debt.</p>

                                    start throwing all your “extra” money into investments quite yet. It’s time to build
                                    your full emergency fund. Ask yourself, “What would it take for me to live for three
                                    to six months if I lost my income?” Your answer to that question is how much you should
                                    save.
                                </p>

                                <p>Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a major impact on you and
                                    your family. Keep these savings in a money market account. Remember, this stash of money
                                    is not an investment; it is insurance you’re paying to yourself, a buffer between you
                                    and life.</p>

                                <p>Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth IRAs and pre-tax retirement
                                    plans. Don’t invest more than that because the extra money will help you complete the
                                    next two steps: college savings and paying off your home early.</p>

               <p>
                 An emergency fund is for those unexpected events in life that you can’t
                 plan for: the loss of a job, an unexpected pregnancy, a faulty car
                 transmission, and the list goes on and on. It’s not a matter of if
                 these events will happen; it’s simply a matter of when they will happen.
               </p>
               <p>
                 This beginning emergency fund will keep life’s little Murphies from
                 turning into new debt while you work off the old debt. If a real
                 emergency happens, you can handle it with your emergency fund. No
                 more borrowing. It’s time to break the cycle of debt!
              </p>

               <p>
                 List your debts, excluding the house, in order. The smallest balance
                 should be your number one priority. Don’t worry about interest rates
                 unless two debts have similar payoffs. If that’s the case, then list
                 the higher interest rate debt first.
               </p>
               <p>
                 The point of the debt snowball is simply this: You need some quick
                 wins in order to stay pumped up about getting out of debt! Paying off
                 debt is not always about math. It’s about motivation. Personal
                 finance is 20% head knowledge and 80% behavior. When you start
                 knocking off the easier debts, you will see results and you will stay
                 motivated to dump your debt.

               <p>
                 Once you complete the first two baby steps, you will have built
                 serious momentum. But don’t start throwing all your “extra” money
                 into investments quite yet. It’s time to build your full emergency
                 fund. Ask yourself, “What would it take for me to live for three to
                 six months if I lost my income?” Your answer to that question is how
                 much you should save.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Use this money for emergencies only: incidents that would have a
                 major impact on you and your family. Keep these savings in a money
                 market account. Remember, this stash of money is not an investment;
                 it is insurance you’re paying to yourself, a buffer between you and
                 life.

               <img src="/assets/images/headings/heading_bs4.png" alt="Baby Step 4 Invest 15% of household income for retirement"/>
               <p>
                 When you reach this step, you’ll have no payments—except the
                 house—and a fully funded emergency fund. Now it’s time to get
                 serious about building wealth.
               </p>
               <p>
                 Dave suggests investing 15% of your household income into Roth IRAs
                 and pre-tax retirement plans. Don’t invest more than that because the
                 extra money will help you complete the next two steps: college
                 savings and paying off your home early.

               <img src="/assets/images/headings/heading_bs5.png" alt="Baby Step 5 College funding for children"/>
               <p>
                 By this point, you should have already started Baby Step 4—investing
                 15% of your income—before saving for college. Whether you are saving
                 for you or your child to go to college, you need to start now.
               </p>
               <p>
                 In order to have enough money saved for college, you need to have a
                 goal. Determine how much per month you should be saving at 12%
                 interest in order to have enough for college. If you save at 12% and
                 inflation is at 4%, then you are moving ahead of inflation at a net
                 of 8% per year!

               <p>
                 Now it’s time to begin chunking all of your extra money toward the
                 mortgage. You are getting closer to realizing the dream of a life
                 with no house payments.
               </p>
               <p>
                 As you attack this last debt, you will gain momentum much like you
                 did back in the second step of the debt snowball. Remember, having
                 absolutely no payments is totally within your reach!

               <p>
                 It’s time to build wealth and give like never before. Leave an
                 inheritance for future generations, and bless others now with your
                 excess. It's really the only way to live!
               </p>
               <p>
                 Golda Meir says, “You can’t shake hands with a clenched fist.” Vow to
                 never hold your money so tightly that you never give any away.
                 Hoarding money is not the way to wealth. Save for yourself, save for
                 your family’s future, and be gracious enough to bless others. You can
                 do all three at the same time.

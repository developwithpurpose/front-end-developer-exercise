Hello All,

I used JavaScript / JQuery makes the content scroll. The site uses jump links to move to  
the step desired step. If the JavaScript is disabled, it will still work correctly. 

The sidebar links using a child of the image when in the hover state to change the image.  The color of the font changes according to the mock-up.

I am stronger at AppleScripting than JavaScript and JQuery right now.  While I  
understand what the project required, I was not able to correctly count the number of  
instances of each babyStep.  

I was able display no dynamic content if no one was at that step, since there was no  
index.

The next step would have been to return the name of the person, if only one person was  at that step. I was able to work around that with an inquiry of the index of that true statement within the JSON. If it was true, the index displayed the person's First and last  name the dynamic content section. 

The following step would have displayed the name of two people of the true  
statements, sorted by last name.  Since I was not able to correctly capture the number of  people at each step, I could not return the value (minus that 2) of the others who were  
also at that step.  Currently, the names displayed are the first names listed in the JSON  
each step.

I looked a great deal to solve all of these challenges (jQuery library,  Google, stackexchange.com, etc.) but had conflicts trying to display the content as  
directed.  I am willing to learn and improve my scripting and welcome the opportunity to learn more from the other developers at Ramsey Solutions.

Thank you for your consideration!
